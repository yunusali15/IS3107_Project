Meta and Nvidia CEOs Mark Zuckerberg and Jensen Huang just gave us a Big Tech fashion crossover for the books.

On Tuesday, Zuckerberg uploaded a photo he'd taken with Huang to Instagram.

""Jersey swap,"" Zuckerberg wrote in the post's caption.

The Meta chief was wearing Huang's iconic black leather jacket, while Huang sported the brown coat Zuckerberg wore during his recent trip to Asia.

""He's like Taylor Swift, but for tech,"" Zuckerberg said of Huang in a comment on his post.

Zuckerberg's fashion post marks another step in the tech founder's style evolution. The Meta chief was once known for sticking to a bland uniform of gray t-shirts and hoodies, but he's now traded that for more adventurous fits.

Besides his shearling brown jacket, Zuckerberg went all-in on ""loud luxury"" when he attended the Ambani family's pre-wedding celebrations earlier this month. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, were seen dressed in all-black outfits designed by Alexander McQueen.

It's not just clothes. Zuckerberg also seems to have acquired a taste for luxury timepieces, too. The tech billionaire was seen getting major watch envy over Anant Ambani's Richard Mille watch during the latter's pre-wedding celebrations.

""You know, I never really wanted to get a watch. But after seeing that, I was like, watches are cool,"" Zuckerberg said.

It is unclear when the photo of Huang and Zuckerberg was taken or when they met. Representatives for Meta did not immediately respond to queries from BI, while a representative for Nvidia declined to comment on the photo.

A meeting between Zuckerberg and Huang wouldn't be surprising considering Zuckerberg's ambitions to expand aggressively into the AI space.

In an earnings call last year, Zuckerberg told investors that AI will be Meta's ""biggest investment area in 2024 for engineering and compute resources.""

Some of those investments have gone into buying chips from Nvidia.

Zuckerberg told The Verge in an interview published in January that Meta is projected to own more than 340,000 Nvidia H100 GPUs by the end of this year. The huge pile of chips that Meta is acquiring is becoming a prime source of envy to the company's rivals, given the need for GPUs to train and deploy AI models.

""We have built up the capacity to do this at a scale that may be larger than any other individual company,"" Zuckerberg told The Verge. ""I think a lot of people may not appreciate that."""

A Meta employee described the company's new internal communications policies that ban the discussion of certain sensitive topics at work as ""toxic"" after accusing the firm of censoring pro-Palestinian views on its platforms and internally among staff.

The NYC-based employee, who has worked at Meta since 2021, per her LinkedIn profile, previously said she was investigated in December for circulating a letter internally that raised awareness about the company's censorship of discussions about Palestine.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

In an Instagram video posted in January, she said: ""Internally we have been trying to raise these concerns and alarms but there is a rule that you cannot talk about disruptive topics, so anything we post about in regards to Palestine gets taken down.""

According to the video, her letter was flagged for violating company rules and was later deleted. She was then placed under investigation and lost access to internal systems.

Meta changed its policies on internal communications in late 2022, introducing a set of rules — known as Community Engagement Expectations — to limit staff from discussing certain topics at work.

Some off-limit topics included abortion, gun rights, the effectiveness of vaccines, and political issues.

In an Instagram post on Monday, the employee said she was told that she had ""repeatedly violated"" these guidelines and that Meta was investigating ""concerns about the alleged inappropriate use of our systems to disseminate the open letter.""

She explained that although the letter received nearly 500 signatures, Meta leadership ""deleted the letter,"" including copies of it, and ""ignored it, and never addressed it again.""

She added: ""@meta, please stop internally censoring employees and get rid of the toxic CEE,"" referring to the company's new workplace discussion rules.

A spokesperson for Meta said the company does not comment on internal personnel matters but said that these new rules are in place ""to ensure that internal discussions remain healthy and productive.""

""This comes with the trade-off that we'll no longer allow for every type of expression at work, but we think this is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our internal community,"" they said."
"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",Eleanor Pringle,Zuckerberg hails Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang as the ‘Taylor Swift of tech’,Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says Nvidia boss Jensen Huang is the 'Taylor Swift of tech' after pair swap jackets.,https://fortune.com/2024/03/28/mark-zuckerberg-jensen-huang-taylor-swift-tech/,"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/Copy-of-FeatTemplate-42.jpg?resize=1200,600",2024-03-28 11:47:13+00:00,"Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Nvidia boss Jensen Huang have given the tech world the crossover no one knew they needed, complete with wardrobe swaps and gushing compliments.

But their collaboration goes deeper than an Instagram shot—their relationship is a pillar holding up the S&P 500.

Facebook founder Zuckerberg posted a photo with chip titan Huang captioned “Jersey swap” on Instagram—a social media app he also owns.

The photo showed Zuckerberg wearing Huang’s signature black leather jacket, while Huang donned Zuckerberg’s brown-and-cream shearling coat.

With Zuckerberg’s net wealth of $175 billion and Huang’s $79.5 billion, the post quickly caught the imagination of followers and gained more than 151,000 likes within 24 hours of posting.

While fans flooded to comment on the pair’s outfits, the fanboying didn’t stop there.

Replying to one fan who was unfamiliar with Huang’s identity, dad of three Zuckerberg replied: “He’s like Taylor Swift, but for tech.”

The ‘Taylor Swift of tech’

Swift has dominated the news over the past year courtesy of her Eras Tour, which saw the “Love Story” singer become a billionaire while generating so much economic activity that Wall Street began penning notes on her activity.

Huang has had a similarly stratospheric start to 2024.

So far the chipmaker’s stock is up nearly 90% for the year to date with Wall Street remaining generally bullish on the continuing outlook.

Zuckerberg also hinted this won’t be the last unexpected fashion interaction between the pair.

Replying to another comment, Harvard dropout Zuckerberg said: “I did get Jensen a black shearling coat for his collection that I’ll give to him next time I see him.”

The comment section on Zuck’s Instagram page also gave a tongue-in-cheek insight into what the pair might have discussed.

One user questioned whether the meet was about Meta buying H100 chips—which Zuckerberg said in January he was stockpiling to a level of 340,000 by the end of the year.

But Zuckerberg responded: “Planning for those B100s.”

Nvidia’s Blackwell B100 is an AI chip already being used by Amazon Web Services.

Why the Zuckerberg-Huang link-up matters

The relationship between Meta and Nvidia is mutually beneficial.

For starters, Meta is widely reported to be one of Nvidia’s biggest customers.

In January, Zuckerberg indicated he was spending billions of dollars a year on H100 chips, saying his company was building a “massive compute infrastructure.”

In an Instagram reels post, he added that this will include 350,000 of the Nvidia graphics cards.

On eBay, these chips sell for anywhere up to $48,000, while analysts told CNBC they expect the business is directly selling at $25,000 to $30,000.

Huang has also been outspoken about Meta’s input into the AI race.

Speaking at the World Governments Summit in Dubai earlier this year, Huang said: “Let’s face it, the single most important thing that has happened last year—if you were to ask me—the one, single, most important event last year and how it has activated AI researchers here in this region is actually Llama 2.”

Llama 2 is Meta’s open-source large-language model, which is available for free for both research and commercial use.

And while Huang has signposted Meta’s contribution to the sector, Zuckerberg’s confidence in a supply of chips—a concern for many tech businesses—will also allow him to deliver on the AI promises that have boosted Wall Street’s confidence in the business.

Zuckerberg’s wealth has soared since he took a step back from his metaverse dream to focus on AI technology.

For Meta’s largest individual shareholder, a combination of a 2023 “year of efficiency” and making AI the company’s priority resulted in a near $40 billion boost last year.

Indeed, in February the term “AI” was used more than 80 times by Meta staffers on the company’s earnings call—a move that has proved something of a surefire way to pique the interest of investors.

Courtesy of the positive picture Zuckerberg and his team had for analysts—and the clear show of focus on the emerging technology—Meta’s share price shot up 20% in the hours following the announcement.

The support between the pair comes at the very top of the stock market: The couple are two of the Magnificent Seven stocks, the Herculean shares that have held up the S&P 500 in recent years.

This smooth relationship between the two has contributed to confidence among investors and share price gains for both—Meta is up 42% in the year to date—meaning the multibillion-dollar bromance may go far deeper than outerwear."

Article content The suits against Meta, TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. and Snapchat parent Snap Inc. claim the companies deliberately targeting children with products designed to be compulsive, causing disruption in the classroom and making kids more vulnerable to sexual abuse and exploitation. “Endemic social media use is causing an unprecedented youth mental health crisis,” the Toronto District School Board said in a complaint filed in Ontario’s Superior Court. The companies “capitalized on their knowledge that the developing child brain is particularly vulnerable and prone to manipulation by their social media products,” the district said. Similar claims have been made by hundreds of U.S. school districts, who are demanding social media companies pay for the cost of addiction to their platforms. New York City sued the same companies in February, along with Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Meta was sued by the attorneys general of more than 30 states in October. A month later, a judge in Oakland, California, ordered Meta, Google, TikTok and Snap to face hundreds of suits blaming them for hooking young people on their platforms.

Article content Spokespeople for Meta and Bytedance and Snap didn’t immediately reply to emails requesting comment on the Canadian suits. Tonya Johnson, a spokesperson for Snap, said its platform works differently than some of the others. “Snapchat opens directly to a camera – rather than a feed of content – and has no traditional public likes or comments,” Johnson said in an emailed statement. “While we will always have more work to do, we feel good about the role Snapchat plays in helping close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence.” According to the Canadian school boards, about half of Ontario students aren’t getting enough sleep in part because they’re hooked on the platforms, and psychological distress and body dysmorphia are commonplace. That’s forced the schools to spend millions on hiring social workers, youth counsellors and other staff. In its claim, the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board said it’s frequently the target of anonymous social media accounts “that target either students and/or staff with false allegations, hateful and/or derogatory content” that companies often fail to remove.

Saima Akhter, a New York-based data scientist at Meta, claims that she was placed “under investigation” and kicked out of internal systems for “speaking up for Palestine.”

She now alleges the investigation has concluded and she has returned to Meta.

Staffers at Meta are banned from discussing politics, health and weapons under its “community engagement expectations (CEE).”

“External censorship on Meta platforms starts with internal censorship of Meta employees,” Akhter writes in her post on Instagram.

“I am continuing to push for more explanation on why and what they were investigating.

“And I am continuing to ask how employees at Meta can express their concerns to leadership and actually be heard.”

The employee signed off the post by tagging her employer: “@meta, please stop internally censoring employees and get rid of the toxic CEE.”

Fortune has contacted Meta and Akhter for comment.

Pro-Palestine voices “ignored”

Meta introduced CEE at the end of 2022 “to ensure that internal discussions remain respectful,” Lori Goler, the company’s head of people at the time wrote in an internal memo viewed by Fortune.

“This comes with the trade-off that we’ll no longer allow for every type of expression at work, but we think this is the right thing to do for the long-term health of our internal community,” the memo added.

From then on, topics that had previously caused “disruption” including vaccine efficacy, abortion and gun rights were all banned overnight from being discussed in the workplace.

Despite this, Akhter began openly advocating for Palestine amid its escalating conflict with Israel in the wake of Hamas’ Oct. 7 attack.

Meta CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, weighed in on the war which has now claimed over 31,000 lives, calling the terrorist attacks “pure evil.”

“My primary concern is the safety of our employees and their families in Israel and the surrounding region,” Zuckerberg shared on Instagram stories.

A group of Meta employees—including Akhter—then penned and circulated a letter asking Meta to “acknowledge Palestinian lives lost” and “transparent action for internal and external censorship on our platforms.”

“Internally we have been trying to raise these concerns and alarms but there is a rule that you cannot talk about disruptive topics, so anything we post about in regards to Palestine gets taken down,” the Meta employee said in an Instagram video earlier this year before allegedly being placed “under investigation.”

Now, in her latest Instagram post, she has blasted Meta’s leadership team for failing to acknowledge the hundreds of pro-Palestenian voices in the company.

“The letter received nearly 500 signatures, and nearly 100 personal testimonials from employees,” she says. “Leadership deleted the letter (including deleting copies of the letter from employees drives and emails), ignored it, and never addressed it again.”

Censorship on Meta

It’s not the first time that Meta has been accused of silencing pro-Palestinian posts on its platforms since the outbreak of the Israel-Gaza war.

In a scathing 51-page report, Human Rights Watch blasted the social network behemoth for engaging in a “systemic and global” censorship of content in support of Palestine and Palestinians, including the taking down of posts, disabling accounts and restricting users’ ability to interact with others’ posts.

Meta outlined in a blog post on its company website that it did indeed take down “more than 795,000 pieces of content” from its platform in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack because they violated the company’s “Dangerous Organizations and Individuals” policy—this included posts which showed “identifiable victims at the moment of the attack” and ones praising Hamas.

Meanwhile, Black Lives Matter activist Shaun King said that his Instagram account was deactivated last December after he accused Israel of genocide.

“The account was disabled due to multiple instances of praise for designated entities in violation of our policies,” a Meta spokesperson explained to CNBC at the time."

The decision is Meta’s latest defeat this month in a string of rulings over whether the FTC can reopen a 2020 privacy settlement covering allegations that the company breached terms after receiving a $5 billion penalty in 2023. US District Judge Randolph Moss denied Meta’s request for a preliminary injunction on March 14, finding that if the FTC is correct in its claim that Meta is putting consumer privacy at risk, it would be in the public interest for it to move ahead.

Central to the FTC’s proposed amendments to Meta’s settlement is the prohibition on capitalizing on minors’ data and broadening restrictions on facial recognition technology.

Ever since OpenAI launched ChatGPT in November 2023, everyone's been talking about — and trying out — the hot new tech in their personal and professional lives.

That includes some of the world's most influential business leaders.

Many companies aside from OpenAI have released generative AI products with human-like capabilities to cash in on the hype. Users have been turning to the technology to save time and reach their goals.

The new rankings also confirmed Tesla CEO Elon Musk once again lags behind luxury goods titan Bernard Arnault in the race to be the richest person on earth.

The 75-year-old French kingpin Arnault, who oversees fashion empire LVMH with a net worth of $233 billion, led the record-breaking pack of 2,781 billionaires—more than ever before.

Moreover, the report found that 14 people are now centibillionaires with 12-figure fortunes.

Who are the world’s richest people?

Behind Arnault and X owner Musk—who has a fortune of $195 billion—are Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($194 billion), Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg ($177 billion), and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison ($141 billion).

Further down the top 10 are Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett ($133 billion), Microsoft duo Bill Gates ($128 billion) and Steve Ballmer ($121 billion), Asia’s richest person Mukesh Ambani ($116 billion), and Google founder Larry Page ($114 billion).

And while the forerunners are made up of well-known faces, a host of new individuals also made it onto the list.

Swift’s Eras Tour propelled her to a net worth of $1.1 billion, while OpenAI’s CEO Altman also appeared courtesy of $1 billion in wealth.

Altman’s wealth isn’t made up of a stake in the company he runs—he has repeatedly said that he does not own equity in the company.

Rather, much of his traceable wealth is in a web of VC funds and startup investments, which is set to grow with the initial public offering of Reddit, where he’s among the largest shareholders.

The list’s youngest name—and appearing for the first time—is 19-year-old heiress Livia Voigt, who has inherited a $1.1 billion fortune courtesy of stakes in Brazilian wind manufacturer WEG, which was founded by her grandfather.

And despite a reported slowdown in luxury goods sales, fashion designer Christian Louboutin made it into the rankings with a net wealth of $1.2 billion.

America prevailed as home to the world's richest people, boasting a record 813 individuals with a combined wealth of $5.7 trillion.

Coming second: China and Hong Kong, with 473 individuals worth $1.7 trillion.

India ranks third with $954 billion across 200 individuals on the list.

“It’s been an amazing year for the world’s richest people, with more billionaires around the world than ever before,” said Chase Peterson-Withorn, Forbes senior editor, wealth. “Even during times of financial uncertainty for many, the super-rich continue to thrive.”

It's worth noting that Forbes's annual list does differ in its rankings from the likes of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which also places Arnault in the number one spot followed by Bezos.

Musk comes in third, followed by Zuckerberg, Gates, and Ballmer—though the net wealth of the majority differs between the two rankings.

How did Taylor Swift make her billion?

Swift, now a 14-time Grammy award winner, has had a stratospheric 12 months courtesy of her global tour which was the first ever to gross more than $1 billion.

Demand for tickets was so high that Ticketmaster experienced a raft of glitches and technical problems, with the fiasco ending in the cancellation of a public sale for the spots.

Fans traveled from far and wide to see the 34-year-old songstress in action, with research firm QuestionPro finding Swift will add a total of $4.6 billion to the U.S. economy courtesy of consumers spending on meals out, merch, and overnight stays.

As well as live shows, Swift also has a massive catalog of music, estimated by Bloomberg to be worth $400 million since 2019 alone.

This includes the re-releases of albums such as Fearless and 1989, which Swift re-recorded after her masters were sold to music mogul and manager, Scooter Braun.

According to Bloomberg, Swift's earnings from Spotify and YouTube total around $120 million while royalties from music sales rake in another $80 million.

The Pennsylvania-born songwriter and actress also owns property worth a reported $110 million per Bloomberg, with the New York Post listing her assets across a Tribeca townhouse with an attached apartment for security, an eight-bed mansion in Rhode Island, and a penthouse in Nashville.

Also in her portfolio is a four-bedroom Nashville complex with an adjacent guest house, as well as a seven-bedroom home in LA.

Swift is one of a small but powerful group of women on Forbes's rich list.

While women make up just 13% of the world's billionaires, their wealth is growing.

L’Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers's wealth jumped $19 billion since last year's list to $99.5 billion while MacKenzie Scott, Jeff Bezos's ex-wife, is up $11.2 billion from last year to $35.6 billion.

That's despite giving away millions following an ""open call"" to charities and organizations in need of support."

Meta launched a social networking venture called Threads in July 2023, leveraging Instagram's audience to build a new microblogging site to compete with X, formerly known as Twitter.

Here's everything you need to know about the latest addition to Meta's line-up.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

What is the Threads app?

The point of Meta's Threads app is to read and engage in public conversations. On Threads, users can post a ""thread"" — usually a short piece of text — and other users can ""like,"" repost, or reply to the thread.

The Threads app was built by Instagram, and requires an Instagram account to connect, though you'll have to download the Threads standalone app separately.

But unlike Instagram, which is photo- and video-based, Threads is a predominantly text-based social-networking platform, though users can also post media files like photos, links, and short videos.

Threads posts can be up to 500 characters, and, depending on your privacy settings, your posts can either be seen by anyone on the Threads interface or just your approved followers.

Similarly to Facebook and Instagram — with the exception of the stories feature — Threads does not show who has viewed your profile or your posts.

Meta launched Threads in July 2023, but not for the first time. Back when Meta was known only as Facebook, the company released a previous version of Threads in 2019. That initial version was a messaging app geared at competing with Snapchat, but it never gained much traction and was discontinued in 2021.

Threads vs. X (formerly Twitter)

Though a number of social media platforms over the years — like BlueSky, Mastodon, and Truth Social — have tried to unseat X as the top social media app for public discourse, only Threads has had much luck.

Threads was launched at a highly opportune time — Elon Musk took over Twitter in October 2022, renamed it X, and began implementing a number of unpopular changes that caused many users to threaten to abandon ship.

When Meta released Threads, it was able to use Instagram's existing user base to quickly garner downloads and gain a foothold. Threads also gives users the option to follow accounts they already follow on Instagram.

Already, Threads and X share some popular features. Like X's ""For You"" page, Threads displays posts in a long feed on the homepage. This feed features posts from accounts users follow, and accounts they don't follow but may be interested in.

Like X, Threads also has a character limit on posts. But unlike X, Threads gives users 500 characters. X users are limited to 280 characters, unless they subscribe to Twitter Blue for $8 a month, in which case they get 25,000 characters.

In March 2024, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced an update to Threads that made the app even more similar to X: A ""Trending Now"" feature to better circulate popular and widely discussed topics and posts.

Safety, privacy, and content on Threads

When Threads first launched, users complained because they realized they couldn't delete their Threads accounts without also deleting their Instagram accounts. NurPhoto/Getty Images.

Threads initially sparked safety and privacy concerns upon its launch — the app grants user data access to third-party services more freely than Meta's other products, like Facebook and Instagram.

Threads also angered users initially by not permitting users to delete their Threads accounts without also deleting their Instagram accounts. Users said they felt ""trapped,"" and within months, Instagram rolled out a feature for users to delete a Threads account without losing the accompanying Instagram account.

Like Instagram, Threads has clear guidelines/policies against NSFW content, such as nudity and explicit sexual content. And unlike its rival, X, Threads is also less oriented towards politics and news content. Instagram CEO Adam Mosseri has called Threads a brand-safe space, and a ""less angry place"" for public discourse.

As a result, critics have speculated that Threads will be boring, and better for brands than for its actual human users.

Do people actually use Threads?

Though Threads had a blockbuster launch, immediately garnering 150 million downloads and 100 million active users within days, usage quickly fell.

To address the slump, Meta added a number of new features to Threads to lure back those users and made the platform available in the European Union. By the end of 2023, Threads was the most popular app in the US Apple App Store.

Threads' surge also coincided with a drop in usage at X, though, like Meta, Musk has spoken of plans to add new features to boost usage.

It remains unclear whether Threads has true staying power, or if it will fully replace X as the top microblogging website, but Zuckerberg has expressed optimism that one day Threads could become ""a 1 billion-person conversation app."""
"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}","Matt O'Brien, The Associated Press",What is AGI and how will we know when it’s been attained?,"Achieving AGI is the driving mission of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and a priority for the elite research wings of tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft.",https://fortune.com/2024/04/05/what-is-agi-artificial-general-intelligence/,"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1505949625-e1712307281732.jpg?resize=1200,600",2024-04-05 08:55:45+00:00,"There’s a race underway to build artificial general intelligence, a futuristic vision of machines that are as broadly smart as humans or at least can do many things as well as people can.

Achieving such a concept — commonly referred to as AGI — is the driving mission of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and a priority for the elite research wings of tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft.

It’s also a cause for concern for world governments. Leading AI scientists published research Thursday in the journal Science warning that unchecked AI agents with “long-term planning” skills could pose an existential risk to humanity.

But what exactly is AGI and how will we know when it’s been attained? Once on the fringe of computer science, it’s now a buzzword that’s being constantly redefined by those trying to make it happen.

What is AGI?

Not to be confused with the similar-sounding generative AI — which describes the AI systems behind the crop of tools that “generate” new documents, images and sounds — artificial general intelligence is a more nebulous idea.

It’s not a technical term but “a serious, though ill-defined, concept,” said Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering AI scientist who’s been dubbed a “Godfather of AI.”

“I don’t think there is agreement on what the term means,” Hinton said by email this week. “I use it to mean AI that is at least as good as humans at nearly all of the cognitive things that humans do.”

Hinton prefers a different term — superintelligence — “for AGIs that are better than humans.”

A small group of early proponents of the term AGI were looking to evoke how mid-20th century computer scientists envisioned an intelligent machine. That was before AI research branched into subfields that advanced specialized and commercially viable versions of the technology — from face recognition to speech-recognizing voice assistants like Siri and Alexa.

Mainstream AI research “turned away from the original vision of artificial intelligence, which at the beginning was pretty ambitious,” said Pei Wang, a professor who teaches an AGI course at Temple University and helped organize the first AGI conference in 2008.

Putting the ‘G’ in AGI was a signal to those who “still want to do the big thing. We don’t want to build tools. We want to build a thinking machine,” Wang said.

Are we at AGI yet?

Without a clear definition, it’s hard to know when a company or group of researchers will have achieved artificial general intelligence — or if they already have.

“Twenty years ago, I think people would have happily agreed that systems with the ability of GPT-4 or (Google’s) Gemini had achieved general intelligence comparable to that of humans,” Hinton said. “Being able to answer more or less any question in a sensible way would have passed the test. But now that AI can do that, people want to change the test.”

Improvements in “autoregressive” AI techniques that predict the most plausible next word in a sequence, combined with massive computing power to train those systems on troves of data, have led to impressive chatbots, but they’re still not quite the AGI that many people had in mind. Getting to AGI requires technology that can perform just as well as humans in a wide variety of tasks, including reasoning, planning and the ability to learn from experiences.

Some researchers would like to find consensus on how to measure it. It’s one of the topics of an upcoming AGI workshop next month in Vienna, Austria — the first at a major AI research conference.

“This really needs a community’s effort and attention so that mutually we can agree on some sort of classifications of AGI,” said workshop organizer Jiaxuan You, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. One idea is to segment it into levels in the same way that carmakers try to benchmark the path between cruise control and fully self-driving vehicles.

Others plan to figure it out on their own. San Francisco company OpenAI has given its nonprofit board of directors — whose members include a former U.S. Treasury secretary — the responsibility of deciding when its AI systems have reached the point at which they “outperform humans at most economically valuable work.”

“The board determines when we’ve attained AGI,” says OpenAI’s own explanation of its governance structure. Such an achievement would cut off the company’s biggest partner, Microsoft, from the rights to commercialize such a system, since the terms of their agreements “only apply to pre-AGI technology.”

Is AGI dangerous?

Hinton made global headlines last year when he quit Google and sounded a warning about AI’s existential dangers. A new Science study published Thursday could reinforce those concerns.

Its lead author is Michael Cohen, a University of California, Berkeley, researcher who studies the “expected behavior of generally intelligent artificial agents,” particularly those competent enough to “present a real threat to us by out planning us.”

Cohen made clear in an interview Thursday that such long-term AI planning agents don’t yet exist. But “they have the potential” to get more advanced as tech companies seek to combine today’s chatbot technology with more deliberate planning skills using a technique known as reinforcement learning.

“Giving an advanced AI system the objective to maximize its reward and, at some point, withholding reward from it, strongly incentivizes the AI system to take humans out of the loop, if it has the opportunity,” according to the paper whose co-authors include prominent AI scientists Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell and law professor and former OpenAI adviser Gillian Hadfield.

“I hope we’ve made the case that people in government (need) to start thinking seriously about exactly what regulations we need to address this problem,” Cohen said. For now, “governments only know what these companies decide to tell them.”

Too legit to quit AGI?

With so much money riding on the promise of AI advances, it’s no surprise that AGI is also becoming a corporate buzzword that sometimes attracts a quasi-religious fervor.

It’s divided some of the tech world between those who argue it should be developed slowly and carefully and others — including venture capitalists and rapper MC Hammer — who’ve declared themselves part of an “accelerationist” camp.

The London-based startup DeepMind, founded in 2010 and now part of Google, was one of the first companies to explicitly set out to develop AGI. OpenAI did the same in 2015 with a safety-focused pledge.

But now it might seem that everyone else is jumping on the bandwagon. Google co-founder Sergey Brin was recently seen hanging out at a California venue called the AGI House. And less than three years after changing its name from Facebook to focus on virtual worlds, Meta Platforms in January revealed that AGI was also on the top of its agenda.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company’s long-term goal was “building full general intelligence” that would require advances in reasoning, planning, coding and other cognitive abilities. While Zuckerberg’s company has long had researchers focused on those subjects, his attention marked a change in tone.

At Amazon, one sign of the new messaging was when the head scientist for the voice assistant Alexa switched job titles to become head scientist for AGI.

While not as tangible to Wall Street as generative AI, broadcasting AGI ambitions may help recruit AI talent who have a choice in where they want to work.

In deciding between an “old-school AI institute” or one whose “goal is to build AGI” and has sufficient resources to do so, many would choose the latter, said You, the University of Illinois researcher."

We already knew that Instagram is a giant app that makes up a significant chunk of Meta's overall business.

But now we know just how big it truly is, courtesy of a new court filing: In 2021, the photo and video app generated $32.4 billion in ad revenue — that's 27% of Meta's overall revenue.

More context: Instagram made more money selling ads that year than Google's YouTube, which generated $28.8 billion in ad revenue. (Analysts at MoffettNathanson peg YouTube's overall revenue for that year at $35.4 billion, after factoring in the money it makes from its music and TV subscription services.)

Meta blocked a newspaper’s critical report about it on Facebook and its other social sites for hours, sparking a backlash that intensified after the company appeared to subsequently block links to the website of an independent journalist who republished the report.

The controversy began Thursday morning when users noticed that all links to the non-profit newspaper the Kansas Reflector had been flagged as a cybersecurity threat and their posts were removed. About seven hours later, the paper said, most of its links had been restored, save for one — a column that had criticized Facebook and accused it of suppressing posts related to climate change.

Meta apologized to the Reflector and its readers on Thursday for what the company’s communications chief, Andy Stone, called a “an error that had nothing to do with the Reflector’s recent criticism of Meta.”

But on Friday, users who attempted to share the column on Facebook, Instagram or Threads , were shown a warning that it violated community guidelines. That seemed suspicious to Marisa Kabas, an independent journalist in New York, who asked the Reflector for permission to publish the text of the column on her own website, the Handbasket.

“I thought it would be a cool experiment,” Kabas told CNN on Friday. Around 1pm ET, she published the story on her own site, “in an attempt to sidestep Meta’s censorship,” she wrote in a preface to the column.

She then shared her post on Threads. “A couple minutes later, I got an alert that it had been flagged and taken down for malicious content,” Kabas told CNN.

Kabas’s post was banned from all Meta platforms for several hours Friday. And for about two hours, she said, all of the links to her site were blocked. Her links were all restored by late afternoon Friday, she said.

In a Threads post on Friday, Stone said the blocked links were “due to a security error” that also mistakenly blocked links to The Handbasket and the nonprofit news aggregator site News From The States.

“The incorrectly applied blocks have now been lifted,” he wrote. “This is undoubtedly frustrating and we sincerely apologize to all who have been impacted.”

Stone didn’t immediately reply to CNN’s request for details about the security concern.

“Sounds like a bug with our share scraper or possibly that the domain is getting caught up in a safety measure by mistake,” said Instagram head Adam Mosseri in a threads post Friday. “We certainly don’t block links to articles that are critical about us … I’ll talk to the team now though and chase down the bug so we can get it fixed ASAP.”

The editor-in-chief of the Kansas Reflector, Sherman Smith, wrote on Friday that Stone “wouldn’t elaborate on how the mistake happened and said there would be no further explanation.”

Kabas said the damage had already been done because the articles had already been flagged as malicious. “That’s a big problem, because that undermines our trust,” she said."

Musk, who ranked first on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index as recently as early March, fell to fourth after Reuters reported Tesla Inc. had canceled plans for a less-expensive car, sending shares lower. (Musk denied the report.) That followed news earlier in the week that Tesla’s vehicle deliveries fell in the three months through March, their first year-over-year decline since the early days of the Covid pandemic.

Musk’s wealth has shrunk by $48.4 billion this year, while Zuckerberg has added $58.9 billion to his fortune as Meta Platforms Inc. climbs to fresh highs, including a new record on Friday.

It’s the first time Zuckerberg has broken into the top three on Bloomberg’s ranking of the richest people since Nov. 16, 2020, when he was worth $105.6 billion and Musk’s fortune was $102.1 billion. Musk now has a net worth of $180.6 billion; Zuckerberg’s is $186.9 billion.

The reversal of the wealth gap between Musk and Zuckerberg, which was as big as $215 billion in November 2021, illustrates how once-hot electric vehicle stocks have been usurped by big tech, and particularly anything involving artificial intelligence.

Tesla shares have fallen 34% this year, making it the worst performer in the S&P 500 Index. It’s been battered by a global slowdown in EV demand, growing competition in China and production problems in Germany. Meta, meanwhile, has surged 49% thanks to strong quarterly earnings and excitement about the company’s AI initiatives. It’s the fifth-best performer on the S&P 500.

The two billionaires’ rivalry extends beyond their wealth: Musk and Zuckerberg have been engaged in an ongoing public spat that intensified when Meta launched Threads, a social-media platform that competes with Musk’s X. The two even traded barbs last year about a possible cage fight. Musk, 52, recently revived the idea on X, saying he would fight Zuckerberg, 39, “anywhere, anytime.”

Musk’s net worth could take a further hit after his $55 billion Tesla pay package was struck down by a Delaware judge. The Bloomberg Billionaires Index continues to use the options from that pay package, which are one of Musk’s largest assets, in its calculations of his wealth.

Bernard Arnault, the chairman of luxury giant LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos hold the first two spots on Bloomberg’s wealth ranking with fortunes of $223.4 billion and $207.3 billion, respectively."

Tech giants are scrambling to find new data sources to fuel the AI arms race.

And at Meta, the issue has been so critical that executives met almost daily in March and April of last year to hash out a plan, The New York Times reported.

As AI systems become more powerful, tech companies have been forced to seek data more aggressively, which could open them up to possible copyright violations. Some have suspected OpenAI, for example, of using YouTube to train its video generator, Sora. The company's CTO, Mira Murati, has denied those accusations.

During Meta's meetings, the Times reported that some attendees floated the idea of buying the publishing house Simon & Schuster, which private equity firm KKR purchased for $1.62 billion last August. Others suggested paying $10 a book to obtain the full licensing rights to new titles.

By the time of the meetings, Meta had already summarized many books, essays, and other online works. The company had hired contractors in Africa to bundle together summaries of fiction and nonfiction titles — some of which included copyrighted information. ""We have no way of not collecting that,"" a manager said during a meeting.

Attendees discussed whether the company could just continue collecting data from potentially copyrighted sources without taking the time and money to procure licensing deals. When a lawyer pointed out the ""ethical"" concerns of taking intellectual property, they were greeted with silence, the Times reported.

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sandeep Rao, a 32-year-old software engineer based in San Jose, California. Business Insider has verified his income with documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity.

My salary journey in Big Tech has seen my total compensation — which includes base salary, bonuses, and stocks — increase from $15,000 in 2012 to $685,000 in 2024.

I'm a staff software engineer and have worked at three different tech companies, moving from Oracle to Apple to Meta. Over my career, I've led the development of successful software apps and features from scratch that are used every day by millions of people across the world.

While I have made my career moves primarily based on which areas of software engineering I'd get to work on, compensation is also important to me, so I've been strategic and negotiated for higher salaries with each move.

Tech companies use tools like additional equity to retain high-performing employees. In my experience, if you're consistently a top performer at your organization, it's certainly possible to keep your pay at or above market level and have a rewarding career within your company.

I took a low-paying job to get my foot in the door

While I got my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, I realized midway through college that software engineering was my passion and pivoted to pursue a career in software instead.

My first job was as a software developer at Oracle in India. While Oracle isn't generally low-paying in the tech industry, my salary of 850,000 rupees, or $15,000, was low compared to what new grads were making at that time in competing Big Tech companies like Microsoft or Amazon because it was a ""take it or leave it"" new grad offer.

The work was unappealing to me because it didn't align with my career interests — I didn't want to continue building expertise in that specific area of software engineering — but I took it to get my foot in the door of a Big Tech company and build credibility.

I knew I eventually wanted to end up where all the action is — Silicon Valley. I worked at Oracle from 2012 to 2014, and during this time, I applied to graduate schools in the US because I felt a formal computer science degree would help me compete with the talented people in the Valley.

I got accepted into a graduate program in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. I left behind my family and friends in India and moved to the US with nothing but a suitcase and $65,000 in student debt.

Grad school was hard, but the doors it opened for me made the struggle worth it.

I was ecstatic to get a job at Apple

I finished grad school and got a job as a software engineer at Apple in Cupertino, California, where my base salary was $115,000.

I was ecstatic to work at one of the best companies in the world and felt my dreams were coming true. But I realized I wanted to work on more direct user-facing applications rather than on technology that ran under the hood.

Initially, I considered looking for new opportunities within Apple, but between high taxes, the high cost of living, and my student loans, I felt more compelled to switch companies, given that I'd likely receive a significant salary bump.

I had gotten a very small cost-of-living raise on my base salary at Apple, but it wasn't significant; not getting a bigger raise wasn't a big motivator in my decision to change companies, but it certainly made my choice easier.

My negotiation skills helped me get a 10% salary increase

At the end of 2017, I moved to Meta (then Facebook) in Menlo Park, California. I wanted to experience the culture of younger internet-based companies whose products are used by billions of people.

When I received my offer, I did my research to get a clear understanding of what my market value was and what salary I wanted to land on. I also learned what parts of my total compensation are negotiable, such as stocks and the sign-on bonus, and what is non-negotiable, like base salary and annual bonuses.

I was prepared to negotiate and walked away with an offer of $140,000, which was 10% more than their original offer.

In 2021, I landed a large-scale project at Meta that added a lot of value to the Messenger app and worked with several cross-functional teams across engineering, design, data science, and legal.

My accomplishments, such as this one, and high performance at work got me the promotions, visibility, and leverage to negotiate for higher pay and a successful salary journey.

Every year between 2018 to 2023, my base salary increased — as did my total compensation — through a combination of performance-based yearly stock refreshers, additional boosts from promotions, and stock market appreciation.

Compensation in a tech career usually gets more and more equity-heavy than salary-heavy, so base salaries don't increase as quickly as equity, but my salary and total annual compensation steadily rose:

Oracle

2012-2014: $15,000 total compensation

Grad School

2014-2016: $0 total compensation

Student loan debt: $65,000

2020: $350,000 total compensation (promotion)

2021: $510,000 total compensation

2022: $375,000 total compensation (promotion, but total compensation dropped due to stock price drop)

2023: $545,000 total compensation

In 2024, I'm projected to make $685,000 through a combination of base salary, bonuses, and stock.

Five strategies for increasing my compensation package

Over the years, I learned five salary strategies that helped me grow my salary and overall compensation:

Advertisement

1. Always do your homework about market rates for your role, level, and location — especially when you switch jobs.

Switching jobs is a good way to increase your income.

Even if money may not be the primary motivator for a job switch, I always make sure to be conscious and strategic about my compensation by doing salary research to avoid leaving any money on the table.

When I started doing salary research during my switch to Meta, I found out my market value was much higher than what I was making at Apple at that time. This helped me start my negotiations with Meta at the market rate rather than the salary I was making.

I used Levels.fyi, Blind, and Glassdoor to find salary information and clearly understand my market value. Keep yourself updated on these benchmarks even if you don't plan on a job change anytime soon, so you know you're on par with the market, and any salary difference is offset by other factors such as better work-life balance.

Advertisement

2. Never let your bad salary ""baggage"" carry over to your new job.

If your salary isn't up to market standards right now, don't let it affect your pay at the next job. Otherwise, it'll lead to a cycle where you'll be underpaid for the rest of your career.

Employers and recruiters could use your salary history to give you only a modest raise, while your actual market value could easily be double or triple your most recent salary.

In California, labor laws make it illegal for employers to ask you about your current salary and salary history. You're also allowed to ask potential employers for the pay range for the position you're applying for.

If your state has similar protections, just being aware of this law can help you make any corrections to your pay during negotiations. This helped me start offer negotiations from my market value instead of my current pay.

Advertisement

3. Sometimes, you have to take a leap of faith to make that 10x impact on your career.

That could involve switching from a non-tech job to a tech job or taking a short-term hit for long-term gain. For example, I picked Oracle for my first job despite the low pay and unappealing work so I could build credibility to get into a Tier 1 grad school.

I also took a loan of about $65,000 to pay for Carnegie Mellon, even though I could have chosen to go to a cheaper public university.

Deciding to work at Oracle and attend Carnegie Mellon cost me a few years and a lot of debt, but doing so opened doors unlike anything else, and I haven't looked back ever since.

4. Negotiate to keep your base salary from falling behind

It's inevitable for your salary to fall behind as you stay longer at a company, especially in tech due to restricted stock unit (RSU) ""cliffs.""

Advertisement

Most RSU packages offered to new employees in the tech industry have a two- to four-year vesting period. Unless the employer offers a significant pay bump along the way, total compensation usually takes a drop after this vesting period. Many companies also offer annual performance-based stock refreshers to lower this salary gap, but they're usually not as large as the initial grant.

If you love working at your company and feel forced to move just to get a raise, you can ask your senior leadership to make a ""correction."" After all, it's much more expensive and time-consuming for employers to hire new people than to retain good employees.

Most Big Tech companies have employee retention programs like additional or discretionary equity. Additional equity programs are mainly used to retain high-performing employees, so they're usually highly selective.

This is how I was able to keep my compensation at or above market level despite spending six years at Meta. When I was reaching the end of my vesting period in my fourth year, I had a conversation with my senior leadership to see if there was any room for a pay correction so I could go back to focusing on my work 100% without worrying about salary.

Advertisement

Being prepared with my predicted compensation drop and market data greatly helped me build a cogent narrative going in. If you're consistently a top performer at your organization, it's certainly possible to keep your pay at or above market level and have a rewarding career within your company.

5. Don't assume people will reward your work or anticipate your needs — ask.

Always ask for what you want, whether it's a raise or that interesting project that just came in. The worst that will happen is you'll get a ""no."" If you don't ask, nobody will know, or even worse, people may assume that you're happy with what you have and move on.

I used this strategy when I heard of a new company initiative and asked to be a founding engineer because I was looking to create more impact in my role. Despite the high risk and ambiguity involved, I successfully delivered on the projects, which eventually led to a promotion. None of this would've been possible if I hadn't asked.

At the end of the day, you're your biggest advocate when it comes to your salary and career journey. There's no substitute for hard work, but being strategic about how you achieve your goals can go a long way. Sometimes, you have to take big risks and step out of your comfort zone to get that high-paying dream job.

To get it in your inbox, sign up for free, here.

New York CNN —

A single trillion-dollar company controls Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp. That concentration of digital ownership can create real-world harm, as a recent censorship dispute with Meta lays bare.

Last week, Meta apologized after blocking links by a nonprofit newspaper and an independent journalist who published a report that criticized Facebook and accused it of suppressing posts related to climate change. Meta denied that it was censoring content and blamed an unspecified “security issue.”

Every single link — about 6,000 stories — that the Kansas Reflector had ever posted to Facebook disappeared from the platform on Thursday. For seven hours, anyone trying to post a Reflector link was met with a warning that the the site posed a security risk.

That’s seven hours during which the Reflector staff had no idea why Meta — a tech behemoth no major publisher can ignore, given its grip on the most world’s most popular social sites — had blown up not only years worth of digital labor but also dinged the credibility of the local paper, whose audience was told, erroneously, that its links contained potential malware.

By the end of the day, almost all of the Reflector’s links had come back online, save for one: an opinion piece that criticized Facebook’s policies around paid promotions.

To test theory that that the Reflector’s domain had some kind of security issue, a Brooklyn-based journalist, Marisa Kabas, asked for permission to republish the text of that column on her own website.

But sure enough, when Kabas posted her own link to the column on Threads, Meta flagged it as malicious content and took it down. Then Meta nuked everything her website had ever published on its platforms, a block that lasted at least two hours, Kabas told CNN.

Meta didn’t respond CNN’s request for more information about the security issue. The editor-in-chief of the Kansas Reflector, Sherman Smith, wrote on Friday that Facebook spokesperson Andy Stone “wouldn’t elaborate on how the mistake happened and said there would be no further explanation.”

“What was the security error? We don’t know,” Kabas wrote in her recounting of the situation. “What caused the links to be blocked? We don’t know.” And while all of the links have been restored “our trust has been undermined at a time when people need little reason to distrust the news.”

The Meta-verse

The debacle helps illustrate one of the more pernicious issues of our Extremely Online Era that’s often glossed over in a morass of boring regulatory jargon: the concentration of power in social media.

One of the ironies of the situation is that the first public statement from Meta came Thursday evening on X, site formerly known as Twitter. Naturally, Kabas and the Reflector staff had to move their complaints to one of the few public platforms not operated by Meta, which left mostly X and its smaller rival Bluesky.

“Anyone involved this past week now understands that putting our civic conversation into the hands of a single for-profit business generates profound risks for society as a whole,” wrote Clay Wirestone, the Reflector’s opinion editor.

Of course, Meta is regularly accused of censoring content by people across the political spectrum — people who often misunderstand that Meta is a business and not the Free Speech Police. The difference here is that Meta acknowledged it made a mistake and ultimately fixed it, albeit in a frustratingly opaque way that left content creators with a lot of questions.

Meta controls a whole bunch of the social media ecosystem, and that means there aren’t a lot of competitors to keep it honest. Meanwhile, all of media relies on it because content creators have to get in front of readers if they want to survive.

With nearly 4 billion monthly active users on its platforms — Facebook alone accounts for 3 billion — it’s not hard to see why some folks want to break Meta up, or at the very least create stronger regulations keep it from elbowing everyone else out the market.

Of course, others argue that breaking up Meta wouldn’t necessarily solve the biggest problems with social media — namely that it perpetuates misinformation at an unprecedented speed and scope, wrecks teens’ mental health and creates toxic echo chambers that undermine the promise of democracy. And if you bust up Meta, there may be no stopping another tech giant from filling the void.

We don’t know what happened within Meta to trigger an erroneous block of legitimate news sources last week. But what we do know is that the company’s control over what we see online can have profound effects on the real world. When Meta decides to dramatically reduce referral traffic to media outlets, as it did last year, there’s little anyone outside of Meta can do to push back."

Article content But Native youth are particularly vulnerable to these companies’ addictive “profit-driven design choices,” given historic teen suicide rates and mental health issues across Indian Country, chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street of the Spirit Lake Tribe in North Dakota said in a press release. “Enough is enough. Endless scrolling is rewiring our teenagers’ brains,” added Gena Kakkak, chairwoman of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. “We are demanding these social media corporations take responsibility for intentionally creating dangerous features that ramp up the compulsive use of social media by the youth on our Reservation.” Social media companies accused of ‘deliberate misconduct’ Their lawsuit describes “a sophisticated and intentional effort that has caused a continuing, substantial, and longterm burden to the Tribe and its members,” leaving scarce resources for education, cultural preservation and other social programs. A growing number of similar lawsuits are being pursued by USschool districts, states, cities and other entities, claiming that TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube exploit children and adolescents with features that keep them constantly scrolling and checking their accounts.

Article content New York City, its schools and public hospital system accuse the platforms of fueling a childhood mental health crisis that’s disrupting learning and draining resources. School boards in Ontario, Canada, claim teachers are struggling because platforms designed for compulsive use “have rewired the way children think, behave, and learn.” The Associated Press reached out to the companies for comment. Google said “the allegations in these complaints are simply not true.” “Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,” Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said in a statement. “In collaboration with youth, mental health and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls.” Snap Inc. said it provides an alternative to a feed of online content. “We will always have more work to do, and will continue to work to make Snapchat a platform that helps close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence,” the company’s statement said.

Article content Native children are uniquely stressed out Native Americans experience higher rates of suicide than any other racial demographic in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, jumping nearly 20% from 2015 to 2020 compared with a less-than 1% increase among the overall U.S. population. Mental health care is already difficult to access from remote locations, and generations of colonization and social stigma create more barriers, particularly when the care isn’t culturally appropriate, advocates say. About 87% of people who identify as Native American don’t live on an Indian reservation, according to the 2020 U.S. Census, and social media can help them connect with tradition, culture and other tribal communities. But “they also might experience discrimination online. And social media companies don’t always have great, helpful policies for managing that,” said Andrea Wiglesworth, an enrolled member of the Seneca-Cayuga Nation and Shawnee Tribe who researches stress in Native populations at the University of Minnesota. Native American identity is a complex mix of political and cultural experiences that varies from tribe to tribe and within Indigenous communities, adding a unique layer of stress onto other social pressures, Wiglesworth said.

Article content “I won’t speak for all Native people, but from my lived experience there is this sense of shared responsibility for the well-being of our community and community members,” she added. She said Indigenous people need to think about how they carry that commitment into the digital world. The teenage brain is wired for compulsive responses The science is still emerging about how social media affects teenagers’ mental health. Psychologists and neuroscientists note the potential for both positive and negative side effects, and researchers have yet to draw a direct link between screen time alone and poor mental health outcomes, according to Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the American Psychological Association. What researchers do know is that as an adolescent’s brain develops, it builds and strengthens the connections that guide responses for a variety of human interactions while it creates more receptors for oxytocin and dopamine. This is the brain’s reward system, Prinstein said, and it manifests in adolescents a need for both positive feedback and concern about social punishments.

Prinstein called for new legislation in Senate testimony last year, saying federal regulators should have more power to prohibit exploitative business practices and require social media companies to protect the well-being of children on their platforms. Regulatory efforts focus on TikTok A nationwide investigation by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general is focusing on whether TikTok is harming the mental health of children and young adults by promoting content and boosting engagement. Meanwhile, some Republican-led states have pursued their own lawsuits. Utah accused TikTok in October of baiting children into excessive social media use. Indiana’s lawsuit accusing TikTok of deceiving users about inappropriate content and insecure personal information was dismissed in November. Arkansas has two lawsuits pending, against TikTok and ByteDance. And in Congress, a bipartisan group of senators is supporting the Kids Online Safety Act, which in part would require platform design changes to prevent harm.

Two tribes are suing social media giants, accusing them of contributing to the high suicide rates among Native teenagers by purposely getting kids hooked on their platforms.

The lawsuits were filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Tuesday. One was brought on behalf of the Spirit Lake Tribe in North Dakota, and the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin brought the other. The lawsuits name Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, TikTok, YouTube, and their parent companies, including Meta and Google as defendants.

""Given historic teen suicide and mental health issues on our Reservation and across Indian Country, Native youth are particularly vulnerable to the negative long-term effects resulting from the intentional, profit-driven design choices being made by these social media platforms,"" Lonna Jackson-Street, chairperson of Spirit Lake Nation, said in a statement provided to Business Insider.

The lawsuit said suicide rates for tribal youth in the US are three and a half to four times higher than other racial or ethnic groups, according to the Center for Native American Youth.

""Soaring suicide and mental illness have devastated Tribal communities and have pushed already chronically underfunded mental health programs to the breaking point,"" the lawsuits said.

The lawsuits allege the addictive nature of the platforms has contributed to the youth mental health crisis, including among kids on reservations.

The lawsuits said the social-media companies ""deliberately tweaked the design and operation of their apps to exploit the psychology and neurophysiology of kids"" and that the companies preyed on an already vulnerable group.

Among other things, the lawsuits are seeking ""equitable relief to fund prevention education and treatment for excessive and problematic use of social media.""

""Enough is enough. Endless scrolling is rewiring our teenagers' brains. We are demanding these social media corporations take responsibility for intentionally creating dangerous features that ramp up the compulsive use of social media by the youth on our Reservation,"" Gena Kakkak, chairwoman of the Menominee Indian Tribe, said in a statement.

In collaboration with youth, mental health, and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences and parents with robust controls. The allegations in these complaints are simply not true.""

Meta, TikTok, and Snapchat did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Other lawsuits have been brought over social media addiction, including by dozens of state attorneys general who sued Meta last year. However, these are the first lawsuits over social media addiction brought by federally recognized tribes, according to Robins Kaplan, the firm that filed the suits.

""These social media giants have generated hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue, our complaint alleges, using a growth-at-all-costs strategy that comes at the expense of Native children and teenagers and the Tribal Nations they are part of,"" Tim Purdon, chair of the firm's American Indian Law and Policy Group and lead counsel to the tribes, said in a statement.

New York City also filed a lawsuit against Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and YouTube in February, alleging the addictive nature of their platforms was contributing to the youth mental health crisis.

In response, Snap Inc., the parent company of Snapchat, said in a statement to the Associated Press that their app ""opens directly to a camera — rather than a feed of content that encourages passive scrolling — and has no traditional public likes or comments.""

The statement continued: ""While we will always have more work to do, we feel good about the role Snapchat plays in helping close friends feel connected, happy, and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence.""

A TikTok spokesperson told AP at the time: ""TikTok has industry-leading safeguards to support teens' well-being, including age-restricted features, parental controls, an automatic 60-minute time limit for users under 18, and more.""

Meta also said the company wants ""teens to have safe, age-appropriate experiences online"" and that they have dedicated features aimed at helping kids and parents."

Both companies are touting their new semiconductor models as key to the development of their AI platforms, and as alternatives to the Nvidia chips they—and the rest of the tech industry—have been relying on to power AI data centers.

Hardware is emerging as a key AI growth area. For Big Tech companies with the money and talent to do so, developing in-house chips helps reduce dependence on outside designers such as Nvidia and Intel while also allowing firms to tailor their hardware specifically to their own AI models, boosting performance and saving on energy costs.

These in-house AI chips that Google and Meta just announced pose one of the first real challenges to Nvidia’s dominant position in the AI hardware market. Nvidia controls more than 90% of the AI chips market, and demand for its industry-leading semiconductors is only increasing. But if Nvidia’s biggest customers start making their own chips instead, its soaring share price, up 87% since the start of the year, could suffer.

“From Meta’s point of view … it gives them a bargaining tool with Nvidia,” Edward Wilford, an analyst at tech consultancy Omdia, told Fortune. “It lets Nvidia know that they’re not exclusive, [and] that they have other options. It’s hardware optimized for the AI that they are developing.”

Why does AI need new chips?

AI models require massive amounts of computing power because of the huge amount of data required to train the large language models behind them. Conventional computer chips simply aren’t capable of processing the trillions of data points AI models are built upon, which has spawned a market for AI-specific computer chips, often called “cutting-edge” chips because they’re the most powerful devices on the market.

Semiconductor giant Nvidia has dominated this nascent market: The wait list for Nvidia’s $30,000 flagship AI chip is months long, and demand has pushed the firm’s share price up almost 90% in the past six months.

And rival chipmaker Intel is fighting to stay competitive. It just released its Gaudi 3 AI chip to compete directly with Nvidia. AI developers—from Google and Microsoft down to small startups—are all competing for scarce AI chips, limited by manufacturing capacity.

Why are tech companies starting to make their own chips?

Both Nvidia and Intel can produce only a limited number of chips because they and the rest of the industry rely on Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC to actually assemble their chip designs. With only one manufacturer solidly in the game, the manufacturing lead time for these cutting-edge chips is multiple months. That’s a key factor that led major players in the AI space, such as Google and Meta, to resort to designing their own chips. Alvin Nguyen, a senior analyst at consulting firm Forrester, told Fortune that chips designed by the likes of Google, Meta, and Amazon won’t be as powerful as Nvidia’s top-of-the-line offerings—but that could benefit the companies in terms of speed. They’ll be able to produce them on less specialized assembly lines with shorter wait times, he said.

“If you have something that’s 10% less powerful but you can get it now, I’m buying that every day,” Nguyen said.

Even if the native AI chips Meta and Google are developing are less powerful than Nvidia’s cutting-edge AI chips, they could be better tailored to the company’s specific AI platforms. Nguyen said that in-house chips designed for a company’s own AI platform could be more efficient and save on costs by eliminating unnecessary functions.

“It’s like buying a car. Okay, you need an automatic transmission. But do you need the leather seats, or the heated massage seats?” Nguyen said.

“The benefit for us is that we can build a chip that can handle our specific workloads more efficiently,” Melanie Roe, a Meta spokesperson, wrote in an email to Fortune.

Nvidia’s top-of-the-line chips sell for about $25,000 apiece. They’re extremely powerful tools, and they’re designed to be good at a wide range of applications, from training AI chatbots to generating images to developing recommendation algorithms such as the ones on TikTok and Instagram. That means a slightly less powerful, but more tailored chip could be a better fit for a company such as Meta, for example—which has invested in AI primarily for its recommendation algorithms, not consumer-facing chatbots.

“The Nvidia GPUs are excellent in AI data centers, but they are general purpose,” Brian Colello, equity research lead at Morningstar, told Fortune. “There are likely certain workloads and certain models where a custom chip might be even better.”

The trillion-dollar question

Nguyen said that more specialized in-house chips could have added benefits by virtue of their ability to integrate into existing data centers. Nvidia chips consume a lot of power, and they give off a lot of heat and noise—so much so that tech companies may be forced to redesign or move their data centers to integrate soundproofing and liquid cooling. Less powerful native chips, which consume less energy and release less heat, could solve that problem.

AI chips developed by Meta and Google are long-term bets. Nguyen estimated that these chips took roughly a year and a half to develop, and it’ll likely be months before they’re implemented at a large scale. For the foreseeable future, the entire AI world will continue to depend heavily on Nvidia (and, to a lesser extent, Intel) for its computing hardware needs. Indeed, Mark Zuckerberg recently announced that Meta was on track to own 350,000 Nvidia chips by the end of this year (the company’s set to spend around $18 billion on chips by then). But movement away from outsourcing computing power and toward native chip design could loosen Nvidia’s chokehold on the market.

“The trillion-dollar question for Nvidia’s valuation is the threat of these in-house chips,” Colello said. “If these in-house chips significantly reduce the reliance on Nvidia, there’s probably downside to Nvidia’s stock from here. This development is not surprising, but the execution of it over the next few years is the key valuation question in our mind.”"

Social media giant Meta has lowered the minimum age required to use WhatsApp in Europe to 13 from 16, sparking criticism from children’s rights advocates.

The new age restriction came into force in the European Union Thursday. The new minimum age of 13 was also announced for users in the United Kingdom in February.

The messaging service — which Meta (META) acquired a decade ago — says on its website that the changes ensure “a consistent minimum age requirement for WhatsApp globally.”

However, the lower age limit has ignited criticism from children’s rights advocates in the UK who argue that it further exposes young people to a slew of well-documented online harms.

In a statement Thursday, UK-based campaign group Smartphone Free Childhood called on WhatsApp to reverse the new policy. “WhatsApp are putting shareholder profits first and children’s safety second,” said Daisy Greenwell, the group’s co-founder.

Reducing the age limit is “completely tone-deaf,” she said, “and ignores the increasingly loud alarm bells being rung by scientists, doctors, teachers, child safety experts, parents and mental health experts alike” over the harms of social media use for children.

Vicky Ford, a UK lawmaker from the ruling Conservative Party and member of a key government committee on education, called the decision to lower the minimum age without speaking to parents first “irresponsible,” PA Media reported.

A WhatsApp spokesperson told CNN Friday: “We give all users options to control who can add them to groups and, the first time you receive a message from an unknown number, we give you the option to block and report the account.”

The European Commission, the EU’s executive body, has not responded to a request for comment.

Meta under fire

Meta has been roundly criticized in the past for its push to lower age restrictions across platforms in the United States.

Last year, the company said it was planning to reduce the minimum age for its virtual reality app from 13 to 10 years old, despite pressure from US lawmakers not to market such services to younger users.

CNN also reported last year that Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had personally and repeatedly thwarted initiatives meant to improve th﻿e well-being of teens on Facebook and Instagram, the company’s other platforms.

At times, Zuckerberg directly overruled some of his most senior executives, who had been pushing for greater protections for adolescents, according to internal communications made public as part of an ongoing lawsuit against the company.

But, in a press release Thursday — unrelated to the change in WhatsApp’s age policy in Europe — Meta said it was testing features to protect young people from the dangers of “sextortion” and “intimate image abuse.” It hopes the new features will “make it more difficult for potential scammers and criminals to find and interact with teens.”

Sextortion predators typically trick young victims into believing they are talking to people their own age. They persuade them to send explicit photos and videos, and later threaten to publicize those images unless a payment is sent."
"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Clare Duffy,How Mark Zuckerberg is reimagining the classroom | CNN Business,"Imagine hopping on a school bus and being transported to an immersive, educational tour of the inside of the human body — and no, not on a fictional episode of “The Magic School Bus.” This is the kind of experience that Meta is hoping to enable for students, …",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/15/tech/meta-quest-vr-education/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/ap23270728090740-copy.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2024-04-15 10:00:29+00:00,"New York CNN —

Imagine hopping on a school bus and being transported to an immersive, educational tour of the inside of the human body — and no, not on a fictional episode of “The Magic School Bus.” This is the kind of experience that Meta hopes to enable for students, digitally, through its Quest virtual reality headsets.

Later this year, Meta will launch new software for educators that aims to make it easier to use its VR headsets in the classroom. The tools will let teachers manage and program multiple Quest headsets at once, give them access to a range of education-related apps and provide greater oversight and control of how students are using the devices.

Bringing VR into more classrooms could enable new kinds of learning opportunities, such as allowing high school drama students to feel like they’re having an immersive, real-time experience watching Shakespeare performed at the Globe Theatre in the 17th century. But VR also creates thorny questions about digital safety and the potential harm to humans who are having more digital interactions and fewer in-person ones, as well as questions about whether incorporating the technology in classrooms would really improve learning.

“You will be able to teach biology and chemistry without having to have a fully equipped laboratory in the future … you will be able to walk the streets of Ancient Rome with students,” Meta’s President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg, who has overseen the Quest for education initiative, told me in an interview conducted via virtual reality ahead of the announcement.

The push to make VR more accessible for teachers and students is part of Meta’s long-term, multi-billion dollar bet on the so-called metaverse: The company believes that in the coming years, humans will use virtual reality headsets to spend increasing amounts of time working, learning and interacting in a digital version of the world.

One selling point, according to Meta, is that VR enables things that would be impossible in the real world because of limitations like time, space and gravity. For example, when I interviewed Clegg, I was sitting in an office in Manhattan and he was in one in London, and yet thanks to VR, it felt sort of like we were sitting at a desk together. (I say “sort of” because the bodies people inhabit in Meta’s virtual world still look like leg-less video game avatars that vaguely resemble their human user.)

Still, it remains unclear just how useful virtual reality is in helping students learn better.

“I think that (VR) is one area that really would benefit from having some additional research,” said Vincent Quan, an education researcher and co-executive director of the Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab. “With technology, sure, it can have a lot of promise, but at the same time, it can also be a lot of hype, and I think it’s important to rigorously evaluate these types of technologies … sometimes you don’t know if it’s just flashy and innovative and cool versus actually impactful.”

Quan, who in 2020 was part of a group of researchers who published a broad review of studies on the impact of education technology, said the findings on whether classroom tech leads to improved learning are mixed — and are dependent on what tools are used and how. Meta, meanwhile, points to early studies on the benefits of VR, such as a PwC report from 2022 that found that students who received a “soft skills” training in VR felt more engaged than those who were trained in a more traditional learning environment.

Clegg said the new Quest features are simply a response to requests from teachers who are already using the devices, as well as a growing crop of developers building educational apps for the headsets.

New Mexico University is using the headsets to teach criminal justice students to investigate virtual crime scenes, and Morehouse College has developed a “digital twin campus” to teach students a range of subjects through VR, both through a partner program with Meta to test educational applications of the technology.

“They want this technology to be available to them out of the box, they don’t want to mess around, wasting time individually configuring each of them, and of course, crucially, they want full, complete visibility and control about what students are experiencing,” Clegg said of the feedback from educators who have used the devices that informed the new Quest education software offering.

For students aged 13 to 17, Clegg added that the new software includes special protections, such as blocking access to the Meta Quest app store so they can use only applications that are pre-programmed by teachers on the devices.

Questions about VR in the classroom

The cost to incorporate VR headsets in the classroom could be a hurdle to adoption for the many schools already struggling with limited resources. While cheaper than some other headsets on the market, Meta’s Quest 3 devices still start at $499 each.

“Sometimes with these new ed tech tools, they seem really promising, they seem in theory like they should level the playing field,” Quan said. However, “the kids who would most benefit from additional instruction, they don’t have the resources of the infrastructure to utilize the technology or they don’t really know about the technology, so they don’t end up utilizing it and then it actually makes the inequality gap widen.”

Clegg acknowledged that cost is “always, candidly, an issue when you have new technology being introduced into education.”

“It costs something, so any cost of course is more burdensome for those who have fewer means,” he said. However, he added that experiences like being able to virtually take students to “a museum rather than having to spend the expense of actually transporting them to your nearest museum … I think it could make many really valuable education experiences much cheaper” in the long term.

I also asked Clegg about concerns that having a classroom full of students wearing headsets and interacting in a digital world rather than talking face-to-face — or conducting a virtual biology lab instead of engaging with the physical world — could to some people feel a bit dystopian. He disagrees.

“I think in years to come, we will look back and think it was somewhat dystopian that we instructed rows of children to sit in silence behind desks staring at pages in a book and I think we will actually think, wow, that earlier generation they were basically consigned to this really joyless way of learning,” Clegg said."

A judge has granted Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's motion to dismiss 25 cases that alleged he was personally responsible for Instagram and Facebook fuelling social media addiction.

US district judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers's ruling on Monday excused Zuckerberg from being held personally liable while the case against Meta still stands.

The cases filed sought to hold Zuckerberg personally responsible for keeping children hooked on Meta products. They alleged that the Meta CEO has control over design decisions that targeted higher user engagement and accused him of ignoring warnings that his platforms were unsafe for kids.

The judge said that Zuckerberg couldn't be held liable just because he has a public-facing role at Meta. The ruling aligns with the legal approach that sees executives typically shielded from personal liability.

""The ""plaintiffs' theory would invert the states' ""confidential"" or ""special"" relationship requirements by creating a duty to disclose for any individual recognizable to the public. The Court will not countenance such a novel approach here,"" Rogers ruled.

Rogers is also overseeing hundreds of other lawsuits against social media companies, including Alphabet, Bytedance, and Snap, which accuse the platforms of causing negative mental and physical health effects in children due to social media addiction, per Reuters.

Meta is facing lawsuits by two tribal nations, who are accusing the company, along with Google, TikTok, and Snapchat of fostering social media addiction. They accuse social media companies of contributing to high suicide rates by purposefully getting kids hooked on the platforms."

The vibes on Apple's Vision Pro are mixed, at best: People like the tech but aren't sure why they should use it, which is a problem for a device that sells for $3,500 and up.

But what about high-tech goggles that don't cost that much, and do have things you can do with them — like play games?

Well, those have issues, too. On the one hand, people are buying them: As of 2023, Meta had sold more than 20 million of its Quest headsets, which start at around $500. But they're not using them that much.

More specifically: Teenagers — the group you think would have the most time and inclination to monkey around with headsets — can't be bothered to put on the devices they already own, according to a new survey from Piper Sandler.

Piper's semi-annual report says that 33% of teens report owning a VR device of some sort. But 56% of them say they rarely use it — that's up from 48% two years ago. (The firm surveyed 6,020 US teens with an average age of 16.1)

But if you're a VR/AR/whatever device fan and you're looking for someone to make lemonade out of this data, I've got something for you: Piper says its survey respondents expect to spend $225 on video games in the first half of 2024 alone.

Now, the trick is getting them to spend that money and time on a VR device instead of a console or their phone.

US stocks slid on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 ending with its fourth straight loss as tech stocks led the market lower and investors adjusted their rate expectations following this week's hawkish comments from Jerome Powell.

Nvidia led the loss in tech through the session, with shares of the chip maker sliding by almost 4%. Tech titans like Netflix, Meta, Apple, and Microsoft all ticked lower, and the Nasdaq shed more than 1% on Wednesday.

Investors are coming to terms with the prospect of higher-for-longer interest rates, thanks to a hot inflation print for March and Powell's recent guidance on rate cuts in 2024. The Fed Chair warned that central bankers needed more confidence that inflation was returning to its 2% target, implying rates would stay higher for longer than investors were expecting.

The Fed also rolled out its April Beige Book on Wednesday, which revealed some central bankers are concerned that inflation could see a resurgence.

""On balance, contacts expected that inflation would hold steady at a slow pace moving forward. At the same time, contacts in a few Districts—mostly manufacturers—perceived upside risks to near-term inflation in both input prices and output prices,"" the Beige Book said.

Markets now see a June Fed rate cut as unlikely, pricing in just a 16% chance the Fed will cut at the June FOMC meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool. Most investors are expecting just 1-2 rate cuts by the end of the year, per December interest rate projections, down from six rate cuts anticipated in January.

Investors are waiting on comments from Fed officials after the closing bell and throughout the day Thursday, which could give more guidance on the path of Fed policy through the rest of the year.

Article content Meta, along with leading AI developers Google and OpenAI, and startups such as Anthropic, Cohere and France’s Mistral, have been churning out new AI language models and hoping to persuade customers they’ve got the smartest, handiest or most efficient chatbots. While Meta is saving the most powerful of its AI models, called Llama 3, for later, on Thursday it publicly released two smaller versions of the same Llama 3 system and said it’s now baked into the Meta AI assistant feature in Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. AI language models are trained on vast pools of data that help them predict the most plausible next word in a sentence, with newer versions typically smarter and more capable than their predecessors. Meta’s newest models were built with 8 billion and 70 billion parameters — a measurement of how much data the system is trained on. A bigger, roughly 400 billion-parameter model is still in training. “The vast majority of consumers don’t candidly know or care too much about the underlying base model, but the way they will experience it is just as a much more useful, fun and versatile AI assistant,” said Nick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, in an interview.

Article content He added that Meta’s AI agent is loosening up. Some people found the earlier Llama 2 model — released less than a year ago — to be “a little stiff and sanctimonious sometimes in not responding to what were often perfectly innocuous or innocent prompts and questions,” he said. But in letting down their guard, Meta’s AI agents also were spotted this week posing as humans with made-up life experiences. An official Meta AI chatbot inserted itself into a conversation in a private Facebook group for Manhattan moms, claiming that it, too, had a child in the New York City school district. Confronted by group members, it later apologized before the comments disappeared, according to a series of screenshots shown to The Associated Press. “Apologies for the mistake! I’m just a large language model, I don’t have experiences or children,” the chatbot told the group. One group member who also happens to study AI said it was clear that the agent didn’t know how to differentiate a helpful response from one that would be seen as insensitive, disrespectful or meaningless when generated by AI rather than a human.

Article content “An AI assistant that is not reliably helpful and can be actively harmful puts a lot of the burden on the individuals using it,” said Aleksandra Korolova, an assistant professor of computer science at Princeton University. Clegg said Wednesday he wasn’t aware of the exchange. Facebook’s online help page says the Meta AI agent will join a group conversation if invited, or if someone “asks a question in a post and no one responds within an hour.” The group’s administrators have the ability to turn it off. In another example shown to the AP on Thursday, the agent caused confusion in a forum for swapping unwanted items near Boston. Exactly one hour after a Facebook user posted about looking for certain items, an AI agent offered a “gently used” Canon camera and an “almost-new portable air conditioning unit that I never ended up using.” Meta said in a written statement Thursday that “this is new technology and it may not always return the response we intend, which is the same for all generative AI systems.” The company said it is constantly working to improve the features. In the year after ChatGPT sparked a frenzy for AI technology that generates human-like writing, images, code and sound, the tech industry and academia introduced some 149 large AI systems trained on massive datasets, more than double the year before, according to a Stanford University survey.

Article content They may eventually hit a limit — at least when it comes to data, said Nestor Maslej, a research manager for Stanford’s Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. “I think it’s been clear that if you scale the models on more data, they can become increasingly better,” he said. “But at the same time, these systems are already trained on percentages of all the data that has ever existed on the internet.” More data — acquired and ingested at costs only tech giants can afford, and increasingly subject to copyright disputes and lawsuits _ will continue to drive improvements. “Yet they still cannot plan well,” Maslej said. “They still hallucinate. They’re still making mistakes in reasoning.” Getting to AI systems that can perform higher-level cognitive tasks and commonsense reasoning — where humans still excel_ might require a shift beyond building ever-bigger models. For the flood of businesses trying to adopt generative AI, which model they choose depends on several factors, including cost. Language models, in particular, have been used to power customer service chatbots, write reports and financial insights and summarize long documents.

Article content “You’re seeing companies kind of looking at fit, testing each of the different models for what they’re trying to do and finding some that are better at some areas rather than others,” said Todd Lohr, a leader in technology consulting at KPMG. Unlike other model developers selling their AI services to other businesses, Meta is largely designing its AI products for consumers _ those using its advertising-fueled social networks. Joelle Pineau, Meta’s vice president of AI research, said at a London event last week the company’s goal over time is to make a Llama-powered Meta AI “the most useful assistant in the world.” “In many ways, the models that we have today are going to be child’s play compared to the models coming in five years,” she said. But she said the “question on the table” is whether researchers have been able to fine tune its bigger Llama 3 model so that it’s safe to use and doesn’t, for example, hallucinate or engage in hate speech. In contrast to leading proprietary systems from Google and OpenAI, Meta has so far advocated for a more open approach, publicly releasing key components of its AI systems for others to use. “It’s not just a technical question,” Pineau said. “It is a social question. What is the behavior that we want out of these models? How do we shape that? And if we keep on growing our model ever more in general and powerful without properly socializing them, we are going to have a big problem on our hands.” ___ AP business writers Kelvin Chan in London and Barbara Ortutay in Oakland, California, contributed to this report.

Meta's large language model and AI assistant are getting upgrades.

On Thursday, the company released the first models of Llama 3 in two sizes, 8B and 70B parameters. They've been integrated into Meta AI, the company's artificial-intelligence assistant.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced the ""big AI news"" Thursday in an Instagram post.

""With this new model, we believe Meta AI is now the most intelligent AI assistant that you can freely use,"" he said.

Meta said in a blog post Thursday that its newest models had ""substantially reduced false refusal rates, improved alignment, and increased diversity in model responses,"" as well as progress in reasoning, generating code, and instruction.

""With Llama 3, we set out to build the best open models that are on par with the best proprietary models available today,"" the post said. ""This next generation of Llama demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of industry benchmarks and offers new capabilities, including improved reasoning. We believe these are the best open source models of their class, period.""

While Meta bills Llama as open source, Llama 2 required companies with more than 700 million monthly active users to request a license from the company to use it, which Meta may or may not grant.

In the near future, Meta hopes to ""make Llama 3 multilingual and multimodal, have longer context, and continue to improve overall performance across core LLM capabilities such as reasoning and coding,"" the company said in the blog post.

So what do the changes mean for Meta AI now?

The AI assistant can help with tasks like recommending restaurants, planning trips, and making your emails sound more professional.

Using Meta AI's Imagine feature now produces sharper images faster: They'll start to appear as you're typing and change ""with every few letters typed,"" a press release issued Thursday said.

Meta AI is available across Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, as well as on browsers . The company says multimodal Meta AI is also soon coming to its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. It's rolling out in English in over a dozen countries outside the US.

As for what comes next, Meta says it's working on models that are over 400B parameters and still in training.

""I don't think that today many people really think about Meta AI when they think about the main AI assistants that people use,"" Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg told The Verge in an article published Thursday. ""But I think that this is the moment where we're really going to start introducing it to a lot of people, and I expect it to be quite a major product.""

Meta AI, of course, faces stiff competition from better-known AI assistants, including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, and Anthropic's Claude."

The iPhone maker also removed the messaging services Telegram and Signal, according to consultants tracking the space. Apple, which has consistently complied with one of the world’s most rigid internet censorship regimes, said the Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the apps removed over national security concerns.

The orders come on the heels of a cleanup program Chinese regulators initiated in 2023 that was expected to remove many defunct or unregistered apps from domestic iOS and Android stores, including local ones. In August, China asked all mobile app developers to register with the government by the end of March, or cease operating.

Beijing has barred the use of foreign messaging and social media platforms like WhatsApp for years, using what the industry calls the Great Firewall. That’s helped apps like Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat dominate domestic usage, though Chinese users can still employ virtual private networks to view foreign media.

Less sensitive apps with more substantial Chinese businesses such as Duolingo are expected to comply with the latest regulatory licensing regime to remain operational, said Rich Bishop, co-founder and chief executive officer of AppInChina.

“It will mean that Chinese consumers are pretty much limited to just Chinese apps, with a small number of international ones,” said Bishop, whose consultancy has received dozens of inquiries from companies about how to stay compliant and publish software in China. “That’s quite a big change — so it will further cut off Chinese citizens from the rest of the world in a sense.”

The action against the American tech services comes as the U.S. government is taking steps toward a ban on TikTok, the hit video app from Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. U.S. politicians have also cited national security concerns in their push to force the company to either sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner or face a ban in the U.S. market.

“We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree. The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,” Apple said in a statement. “These apps remain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.”

The app registration process kicked off last year in what Beijing painted as a bid to counter telephone scams and fraud. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it would carry out supervision work on those filings from April to June, and to take action against unregistered apps. Developers would also be required to set up and improve mechanisms to handle “illegal information.”

The MIIT move was regarded as another step by Beijing to tighten controls across its cyberspace, forcing internet companies to scrub information considered politically sensitive. Beyond apps, websites and large language AI models have also been subject to greater content curbs.

The Wall Street Journal was first to report the app removal. A Meta spokesperson referred Bloomberg News to Apple’s statement. Representatives for Telegram and Signal didn’t respond to requests for comment.

China’s action comes as TikTok divestiture legislation is expected to be included in a fast-moving aid package for Ukraine and Israel that Congress is expected to vote on this Saturday.

China is a key nation for the iPhone, its largest consumer market outside the U.S. and its primary production base. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook visited the country earlier this year and emphasized its importance to his business. Apple has long said that it needs to follow local laws as part of operating its app store effectively in different countries."

Article content In the past, subscriber numbers have been wildly unpredictable, and the company has struggled to forecast them accurately. In 2022, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said it would stop projecting quarterly customer data. The stock typically sees big swings the day after earnings reports. On Thursday, Netflix reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, including 9.33 million new subscribers. But the shares slumped after the company said user growth this quarter would slow and that it will stop reporting customer numbers. “Eliminating regular reporting of membership data raises questions around management’s confidence to further grow the base, though it is not implausible that the change is intended to reduce quarterly sentiment volatility around relatively small changes in true economic drivers,” Michael Morris, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Netflix isn’t the only big tech company to pull back on disclosing some metrics in order to steer investors’ focus elsewhere. In 2018, Apple said it would no longer report the number of iPhones, Macs and iPads sold each quarter, as it attempted to focus on its growing services unit. While some pundits praised the move as a way to highlight a potent new business model, others complained it was an attempt to hide the pain of a stagnant smartphone market. The shares had their worst day in four years.

Article content Last quarter, Meta said it will no longer report the number of subscribers to its family of apps, which now total almost 4 billion people who use Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp each month. The San Francisco-based company said it also won’t provide daily and monthly user numbers for its flagship Facebook app. Beginning this quarter, Meta will report year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level, while continuing to report only daily active users across its family of apps. “Fewer disclosures is a rite of passage for large tech companies namely Apple, Google, and Meta,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note. “On the other hand, removing growth disclosures signals a maturing business, and gives shareholders even fewer data points to underwrite forecasts. Time will tell how investors digest the change.” The good news for Netflix is that its decision, while angering some investors, is unlikely to have any impact on customers — its primary focus. In 2011, the company was forced to backtrack on plans to split its mail-order DVD and internet streaming services. Customers were outraged over plans to create a separate DVD offering called Qwikster, and to pay for each service separately. The company reversed the decision three weeks later.

Article content Netflix’s growth in the latest quarter was aided by a crackdown on account sharing, which pushes viewers using someone else’s password to sign up on their own at a discounted rate. The company attracted new customers from all over the world, thanks to a strong slate of original programs, showing particular strength in the US and Canada. Those new subscribers helped the company beat forecasts for sales and earnings as well. In explaining the decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers and average revenue per user, co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters said initiatives like the crackdown and a new ad-supported tier make those metrics less relevant. “All of that means that historical simple math that we all did, number of members times the monthly price is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business,” he said in a video interview Thursday.

Mark Zuckerberg recently made waves across social media after a digitally altered image of him sporting a beard went viral, with fans seemingly thirsting over the Meta mogul.

Fans couldn't resist commenting on the new look, which was a digitally altered screenshot from a video Zuckerberg shared on social media on April 18. In the video, Zuck, dressed simply in a blue T-shirt and a gold chain, introduced the latest version of Meta AI to his over 13 million followers.

Unfortunately for him, the announcement was seemingly overshadowed when the altered photo of the CEO with an added beard surfaced on social media, sending fans into a frenzy.

One user hilariously posted on X (formerly Twitter), ""I'd zuck him off,"" while another compared him to Jack Harlow. ""You vs the guy she doesn't want you to know about"" posted another user, along with a side-by-side of the actual photo vs. the altered, bearded one.

Some fans posted their disappointment upon finding out the image wasn't real, saying things like, ""The glow up is fake!?!? Can't trust y'all anymore for anything smh,"" and ""I thought he had got a glow up,"" alongside a clip of a woman screaming ""I hate when people lie. Do not lie!""

Zuckerberg is no stranger to becoming a meme. Back in 2020, he was photographed surfing in Hawaii using a high-tech $12,000 eFoil surfboard while being tailed by security, wearing an excessive amount of white sunscreen on his face. This image also went wild on social media, with Barstool Sports CEO Dave Portnoy jesting, ""What's the point of being rich if this is what you look like when you surf?""

What's the point of being rich if this is what you look like when you surf? pic.twitter.com/BjnKff2TGB — Dave Portnoy (@stoolpresidente) July 19, 2020

Social media was once again rampant with hilarious memes about the photo. ""Legend has it that every summer, Mark Zuckerberg (aka the Mime Surfer) attempts to catch a wave and until he does, his restless spirit will wander the earth for all eternity,"" posted one user alongside a photoshopped image of Zuck wearing a mime costume.

The sunscreen-heavy face led to a barrage of memes comparing the Meta co-founder to various other characters known for their pale faces, like the Joker, Queen Elizabeth I, as well as the beloved Mrs. Doubtfire, whom Robin Williams portrayed smearing her face with cake icing in the iconic comedy.

While Zuckerberg has yet to respond about the viral bearded photo, some fans hope that he will actually opt for a bearded look, responding to the photo by saying, ""this is his sign to grow it out,"" and ""Lmfao next thing you kno Zuck pop out with tha beard fr. 🤣💀"""

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a hot take on Big Tech's race for AI training data: It's not about the data.



""The thing that I think is going to be more valuable is the feedback loops rather than any kind of upfront corpus,"" Zuckerberg said in an interview with the Command Line , a tech industry newsletter.

Feedback loops are used to retrain and improve AI models over time based on their previous outputs. These algorithms let AI models know when they make an error, for example, and provide them with data to adjust their future performance.

Stone, who is based in the United States, announced temporary changes to Meta’s hate speech policy to allow for “forms of political expression that would normally violate (its) rules, like violent speech such as ‘death to the Russian invaders.”‘

A court in Russia on Monday convicted the spokesperson of U.S. technology company Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, of justifying terrorism and sentenced him to six years in prison in a swift trial in absentia, Russia’s independent news site Mediazona reported.

In the same statement, Stone added that “credible calls for violence against Russian civilians” would remain banned. The Russian authorities opened a criminal case implicating Stone and other unidentified Meta employees nonetheless, describing the statement as “illegal calls to violence and killings of Russian citizens.”

The authorities also outlawed Meta as an extremist organization and blocked Facebook and Instagram in Russia. Both platforms — as well as X, formerly known as Twitter, which has also been blocked _ were popular with Russians before the invasion and the subsequent crackdown on independent media and other forms of critical speech. However, they are now only accessible via VPN.

Mediazona reported that Stone was initially charged with calling for terrorist activity, public calls for extremist activity and publicly justifying terrorism, but the first two charges were dropped in the final version of the indictment. The trial, in which Stone was represented by a government-appointed lawyer, began on Friday and concluded on Monday after only two hearings. Stone was sentenced to six years in a penal colony and barred from administering websites for four more years.

Meta declined to comment on the verdict.

Stocks rallied on Monday, with the S&P 500 rising nearly 1% to snap a six-day streak of losses.

Investors are turning their attention to earnings reports due up from high-profile companies. Tesla will report Tuesday after the closing bell, with Wall Street analysts eyeing potentially more pain for the car company amid the stock's 43% decline already in 2024.

""Facing an investment thesis pivot and a sea of uncertainty, this Tesla call is extra highly anticipated,"" Barclays analysts wrote. ""Expect negative catalyst.""

The narrative in the market has been downbeat, with major averages all losing ground last week amid a weakening macro outlook. The market's view of rate cuts in 2024 has dimmed amid stubbornly high inflation and hawkish Fedspeak that has recalibrated forecasts for monetary policy.

A slew of Fed officials delivered comments last week, with the tone decidedly less dovish than recent remarks, and most indicated that the central bank was in a rush to cut interest rates. The lack of movement from the Fed makes this earnings season particularly important as traders struggle to rescue a strong first-quarter rally that has fizzled in April.

However, a brand new inflation reading could be another source of anxiety on Friday, when markets will get the latest personal consumption expenditures data, which is the Fed' preferred inflation gauge.

""Friday's PCE inflation figures will be highly important in this regard, with markets bracing for a modest uptick in the headline and a mild drop in the core number,"" Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at financial services firm Ebury wrote in a note on Monday.

He prepared anyway.,The founder and CEO of Meta admitted in a podcast interview that he wasn't expecting to use all of the GPU's he's acquired for generative AI tools.,https://www.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-did-not-see-the-genai-wave-coming-2024-4,https://i.insider.com/6626b68623b29110d30195d5?width=1200&format=jpeg,2024-04-22 20:22:30+00:00,"When Mark Zuckerberg started amassing a large amount of GPUs in 2022, it wasn't for anything related to generative artificial intelligence.

Instead, the Meta CEO and cofounder was still focused on the metaverse and thought the graphics processing units, mostly from Nvidia, would be used for ranking content and be a big change to its algorithmic system for Reels, Instagram, and Facebook.

The algorithm went from one based on who a user was following to one based on ""unconnected content,"" or a system that shows a user content from all over an app, typically based on anything they've interacted with. It's an algorithmic style made famous by TikTok, which for a time was growing faster than Meta's apps.

Zuckerberg started to buy up GPUs and change Meta's algorithms and related training infrastructure so Reels could ""catch up to what TikTok was doing,"" he told the podcaster Dwarkesh Patel in an interview, in which the CEO promoted last week's expanded release of the Meta AI chatbot tool and Meta's Llama 3 model.

""We thought it was going to be something that had to do with training large models,"" he said, adding: ""At that time, I was so deep into just trying to get the recommendations working for Reels and other content because, I mean, that's such a big unlock for Facebook and Instagram to now be able to show people content that's interesting to them, from people they're not even following.""

Despite generative AI not being on Zuckerberg's mind until OpenAI's ChatGPT tool exploded onto the tech scene, he did what he could to be ready for the unexpected. Having been caught off guard amid other step changes in tech — the shift to mobile, the political manipulation of content, short-form video — Zuckerberg didn't want to be unpleasantly surprised, yet again.

When speaking with Patel about the need to catch up with TikTok, Zuckerberg said: ""I basically looked at that, and I was like: 'Hey, we have to make sure that we're never in this situation again. So let's order enough GPUs to do what we need to do on Reels and ranking content and feed. But let's also double that.' Again, our normal principle is that there's going to be something on the horizon that we can't see yet.""

The CEO admitted that doubling Meta's investment in GPUs on the off chance the company would need them ""was a good decision in retrospect"" — one that he made because of so many perceived mistakes in the past.

""It came from being behind. It wasn't like, 'Oh, I was so far ahead,'"" Zuckerberg said. ""Actually, most of the time, I think where we kind of make some decisions that end up seeming good is because we messed something up before and just do not want to repeat the mistake.""

Zuckerberg is now the third richest person in the world with a net worth of $171 billion, jumping above No. 4 Musk, who has a net worth of $168 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Meta CEO has gotten tens of billions of dollars richer since the start of the year, according to Bloomberg, in part because of the stellar performance of Meta’s shares.

Although his official salary for a decade has remained steady at $1, Zuckerberg is Meta’s largest and controlling shareholder, with more than 350 million shares, according to the company’s most recent proxy statement. Meta’s shares have skyrocketed about 40% since January, giving Zuckerberg paper gains of about $49 billion on the shares he owns or controls.

Meanwhile, one of Musk’s main sources of wealth, Tesla stock, is struggling. Shares have plummeted 43% since the start of the year, making it the worst performing company in the S&P 500. Musk owns just over 715 million Tesla shares, according to the company’s most recent proxy statement, and their value dropped by $76 billion since January.

Tesla’s lackluster stock performance comes after the company reported its first year-over-year sales decline since the pandemic earlier this month. Over the weekend, the company also cut the price of several vehicles along with its Full Self-Driving software.

Even notable Tesla bulls have recently cast doubt on the company’s direction and are expecting answers from Musk on Tuesday’s earnings call.

But while Musk’s flagship company backslides, he is still trying to secure a $45 billion pay package, after a judge struck it down in January (when it was worth $56 billion). Musk’s big payday could put him above Zuckerberg by net worth, but it’s unclear whether the package will be approved by shareholders at the company’s proxy meeting in June.

The two billionaire executives have been at odds for years. In 2016, Meta contracted SpaceX to launch a satellite that would’ve brought internet access to sub-Saharan Africa. The rocket exploded on the journey, prompting Zuckerberg to write on Facebook that he was “deeply disappointed.” After Musk bought Twitter (now X), Zuckerberg was quick to launch Threads, a look-alike competitor, which Musk later called “eerily quiet.”

Their conflict escalated in June when Musk challenged Zuckerberg in a post on X.

“I’m up for a cage match if he is lol,” he wrote at the time.

Zuckerberg, who has recently taken an interest in martial arts, seemed to take the challenge seriously and was ready to set up the fight. He later called it off, saying Musk wasn’t serious about getting into the ring.

“Dana White offered to make this a legit competition for charity. Elon won’t confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead,” Zuckerberg wrote on Threads. “If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me.”"

Meta Platforms has had a winning year so far, with the stock up 40% and sentiment upbeat ahead of its first-quarter report on Wednesday.

The firm has benefited strongly from rising enthusiasm for artificial intelligence, while Wall Street has highlighted the the company's ad strength, with expected spending momentum set to boost results.

Here's what Wall Street expects from Meta's first-quarter earnings after the closing bell on Wednesday:

Wells Fargo: In need of a new catalyst

Wells Fargo has projected ad-led strength in the first-quarter, with Meta benefiting from a robust e-commerce environment.

For this reason, the bank modestly boosted the firm's revenue growth forecast to above consensus levels, though it expects the trend to moderate in the second quarter. By then, the market will be on the lookout for another product-cycle catalyst to keep ad momentum up.

""See sustainable multiple expansion driven by clear engagement and product catalysts to support the next leg of META share growth, as positive revision cycle driven by macro tailwinds moderates. We view WhatsApp as an under-appreciated asset w/ sizable potential, should Meta invoke more direct monetization beyond Click-to-Message ads,"" analysts led by Ken Gawrelski said.

Wells Fargo rates Meta at ""Overweight"" with a $600 price target.

RBC: well-appreciated and well-owned

RBC sees more strength ahead for Meta as ad volume growth outpaces peers.

For instance, the bank noted that Instagram Reels ads have continued ramping up, increasing 22% from January's 16.4%. That's while competitors such as TikTok have watched ad loads decline.

With sentiment staying strong, RBC also expects mid-teen growth to look achievable if second-quarter earnings expectations are met.

""META is well-appreciated & well-owned, however, solid engagement trends, industry-leading marginal conversion, new ad units and a growing moat still offer very attractive characteristics of an earnings compounder returning capital with open-ended AI optionality, (particularly compute capacity optionality which we think is underappreciated),"" analysts led by Brad Erickson wrote last Thursday.

Some pullback could occur in the first half of the year given China's economic slowdown, which could impact ad spending.

RBC rates Meta at ""Outperform"" with a $600 price target.

Goldman Sachs: ""favored for the long-term

Goldman expects digital advertising to stay strong in the forward twelve months, boosting its first-quarter outlook on Meta.

The sentiment comes as ad dollars shift into digital channels, and digital platform products — such as short-form videos — continue to improve. The bank highlighted the fact that Instagram Reels has reached revenue neutrality, and should remain a key revenue growth tailwind over the coming years.

""We remain constructive on META long term but recognize that there may be less identifiable catalysts with this earnings report when compared to the heightened investor debates (especially on the topic of rate of revenue deceleration),""

Goldman Sachs rates Meta at ""Buy"" and holds a 12-month price target of $555.

Bank of America: Product surprises, revenue momentum ahead

Bank of America is betting on first-quarter upside from higher ad spending, driven up by seasonal events, such as the Leap Year and Easter.

In a note last week, the bank also emphasized that Meta is still in the first inning of an AI-led monetization cycle, and thinks that the firm's AI assets are underappreciated by its market price.

""We remain positive on Meta and reiterate our thesis that Reels, Messaging, and AI driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises & revenue momentum in 2024,"" analysts Justin Post and Nitin Bansal said.

Down the road, Meta could also be the leading winner from TikTok limitations, they said, with a ban on the app moving forward in Washington.

Bank of America rates Meta at ""Buy"" with a $550 price target.

JPMorgan: An ad leader, but caution ahead

Although Meta remains a top idea among JPMorgan analysts, they highlighted concern about cooling growth prospects after the first quarter.

""META remains well-owned, but there is growing caution into earnings on almost-certain growth deceleration beyond 1Q due to tough comps & perception of lack of new drivers vs. '23. We believe slower growth is well-anticipated, & likely taken into account in META's undemanding multiple,"" analysts led by Doug Anmuth wrote last week.

Among positive first-quarter developments the bank is eyeing is Meta's implementation of AI in its ad stack, which JPMorgan sees as a significant contributor to growth and makes the firm an AI leader.

Still, this year's ad growth drivers are little changed from 2023, and deceleration won't come as a surprise among investors: ""We believe META can exit the year growing in the mid-teens% (we model +13%).""

JPMorgan rates Meta at ""Overweight"" with a $535 price target."

The hype around Mark Zuckerberg's new chain necklace lives on, and the story behind it is pretty endearing.

The Meta CEO spoke with Eva Chen, the head of Instagram's fashion partnerships, about developments for Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses and spilled more information on his viral accessory choices.

""I'm in the process of designing a long-term chain,"" he said Tuesday in an Instagram post.

He said that as part of his ""design process,"" he was testing out necklaces that would eventually hold an engraving of a prayer he reads to his daughters.

Zuckerberg was spotted wearing a shorter-looking chain last week, prompting memes and talk of a ""glow-up."" (Another popular image floating around was of the billionaire edited to look as if he had a beard, but the chain is definitely real.)

This new venture into fashion has drawn comparisons to ""mob chic"" trends and rapper swag. But Zuckerberg said the necklace boiled down to a sentimental gesture to his children.

Either way, the move has certainly earned the Meta chief some internet cool points — though perhaps not from Instagram's Chen, who suggested the chain he was wearing in Tuesday's video should be a bit shorter."

Meta reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday after the closing bell.

The company reported revenue and earnings-per-share that beat consensus analyst estimates. But shares slid after Meta gave a range for second-quarter sales that was on the light side of forecasts and said it's going to spend more than it expected this year.

The report is Meta's first without monthly- and daily-average-user numbers specifically broken out for Facebook. The company instead reported overall ""Family of Apps"" results that also included Instagram and WhatsApp. The combined group saw $36 billion of revenue, beating the consensus estimate of $35.5 billion.
