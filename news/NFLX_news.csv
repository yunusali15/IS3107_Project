YouTube is the world's largest video platform. It's the world's second-largest search engine. It plays a massive role in culture.

And most of you don't pay nearly enough attention to it. But Wall Street does: Analyst Michael Nathanson has a new note out estimating that YouTube could be worth as much as $400 billion as a stand-alone company.

Reminder: Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion nearly 20 years ago.

We could spend time here explaining Nathanson's math and assumptions — he thinks that in 2023, YouTube generated operating profits of $5.5 billion on revenues of $45 billion; he also thinks its future growth will be spurred by subscription services like YouTube TV, as its advertising growth slows.

But let's be honest. Those numbers aren't going to sink for many of you. Just like YouTube's massive size doesn't seem to register with politicians like the ones on the US Senate Judiciary Committee, who hosted a big hearing on ""Big Tech and the Online Child Sexual Exploitation Crisis"" in January and grilled the CEOs of Meta, Snap, TikTok, and platforms — and gave YouTube a pass.

So let's try this argument: You know how people like me spend a lot of time tracking who's ""winning"" the streaming wars?

Line up YouTube next to all the big players, and you'll realize, like my colleague Lucia Moses pointed out last month, that it's ridiculous to have a streaming wars conversation without talking about YouTube.

For instance: If you took Netflix ($261 billion market cap) and added in Paramount ($8 billion), Warner Bros Discovery ($21 billion), and Fox ($14 billion), you'd have a company with a combined value of … about $300 billion. Throw in a Roku ($10 billion) if you want. You're still not getting close to the $375 billion to $400 billion value Nathanson is talking about.

Or, alternately: You could combine Comcast ($172 billion) and Disney ($224 billion, after a big ramp-up this year — Nelson Peltz, your services are no longer needed) and end up with a $396 billion company. (You would also get to watch a funny wrestling match between Disney CEO Bob Iger and Comcast CEO Brian Roberts who have a long-standing enmity.)

But those two companies aren't solely reliant on media to make their money — Disney is also selling cruises and theme park passes; Comcast is one of the biggest broadband providers in the US.

So if you're talking about video, and the internet, and advertising and audience and value and you're not talking about YouTube? You're doing it wrong."

An executive who worked on Netflix's ""3 Body Problem"" practiced killing cats and dogs before fatally poisoning his boss, the Chinese outlet Caixin reported.

The New York Times reported that Xu Yao, a former Yoozoo Games executive, was given a death sentence on March 22 after fatally poisoning the company's founder Lin Qi, dubbed China's ""billionaire millennial,"" in 2020.

Lin had a net worth of around 6.8 billion yuan ($940m) when he died, per the Hurun China Rich List.

Yoozoo Games owns the rights to the Chinese-language sci-fi series, ""3 Body Problem,"" which made its Netflix debut in March. The show is based on Liu Cixin's award-winning ""Remembrance of Earth's Past"" book trilogy.

Xu, who joined Yoozoo Games in 2017, killed Lin due to a ""dispute over running the business,"" according to a statement by Shanghai First Intermediate People's Court, cited by the Associated Press.

Related stories

The dispute was after Xu got demoted and received a pay cut due to poor performance, according to the Caixin report cited by The Times.

Xu reportedly plotted Lin's murder in retaliation. He built a lab near Shanghai and experimented with hundreds of poisons from the dark web — often by testing them on pet animals, including cats and dogs — according to Caixin.

Caixin reported that Xu was inspired by the series ""Breaking Bad,"" about a high school teacher diagnosed with lung cancer who begins to make and sell methamphetamine.

The court said four other employees fell ill, but were not killed, after Xu poisoned beverages in the office between September and December 2020 due to grievances he had with two of them, AP reported.

Chinese media named one of the employees poisoned as Zhao Jilong, VP of the company's film division, Variety reported in 2021.

Zhao may have been targeted due to jealousy over his involvement with the company's deal with Netflix. Lin and Zhao were both named as executive producers of ""3 Body Problem"" in the official announcement, while Xu was left uncredited, Variety reported.

Writing on his WeChat account after Xu's sentencing, Zhao said: ""Justice has been served,"" according to Chinese state media cited by The Times.

Meghan became embroiled in a curtsy controversy in 2022 after she performed a dramatic version of the reverential gesture in her Netflix docuseries, Harry & Meghan, which saw her accused of mocking the tradition.

The movement is traditionally offered in Britain by female members of the royal family and court to the monarch as a mark of respect. It comprises a short bend to the knee and a bowing of the head. Curtsies are offered twice each day, once when first greeting the king and queen and then once again when saying goodbye.

Several members of the royal family have been praised by fans for their curtsies over the years, including Princess Diana, Princess Kate, Princess Charlotte and Meghan.

Uploaded to TikTok by user @itsmeren026 on April 2, a post containing three striking images of Meghan performing curtsies to Queen Elizabeth II has gone viral, gaining over 331,000 views on the platform so far.

The first image shown was taken after Queen Elizabeth's death in September 2022, where Meghan joined senior members of the royal family to pay their respects at the monarch's lying-in-state ceremony at Westminster Hall in London. The royals each offered solemn bows and curtsies to the queen's coffin at the end of the event, with Meghan's deep offering caught on camera.

The second and third images of the post were captured on Christmas Day in 2017 and 2018. Meghan became the first royal fiancée to receive an invite to spend Christmas Day with Queen Elizabeth and her family in 2017, prior to her wedding to Prince Harry.

At St. Mary Magdalene Church on the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England, Meghan was photographed curtsying to the queen as she left morning service. This was repeated the following year.

Captioned ""Curtsy from Meghan, Duchess of Sussex,"" the viral post has received in excess of 19,000 likes and almost 500 comments, many of which have praised the royal with others referencing her Netflix curtsy controversy.

""She acted more elegantly than anyone. She has the same energy as Diana. I can feel it,"" wrote one TikTok user.

""The 1st curtsy is everything. Cause I would have fell straight on my face with those heels,"" posted another, with a further comment reading: ""I just remember the Netflix when she made fun of this.""

Netflix's latest film, ""Scoop,"" dramatizes Prince Andrew's infamous TV interview where he tried to defend his friendship with late sex offender and disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein.

In November 2019, the BBC interviewed the prince about his relationship with Epstein, who died by suicide in a jail cell after being charged with sex trafficking dozens of minors.

Speculation about the pair's friendship intensified after Prince Andrew was named in an unsealed document related to a defamation lawsuit filed against Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Virginia Roberts Giuffre, an alleged victim of Epstein who filed the lawsuit in 2015, claimed in the document that Maxwell and Epstein forced her to have sex with Prince Andrew on three occasions, the first time when she was 17.

Prince Andrew denied the claims in August 2019 in a statement released by Buckingham Palace after the documents were unsealed. Still, three months later, the prince agreed to an hourlong interview with Emily Maitlis, a former anchor for the BBC's flagship daily current affairs show ""Newsnight,"" to address the allegations made against him.

The British press branded the interview a ""car crash"" due to what were perceived as Prince Andrew's bizarre responses, which are depicted word for word in ""Scoop.""

These included the prince saying he had no recollection of meeting Giuffre and suggested a photo of him with Maxwell and Giuffre could have been doctored.

When asked what he was doing on March 10, 2001, the night Giufrre alleged the prince had sex with her for the first time, Prince Andrew said he took his daughter, Princess Beatrice, to a party at popular UK restaurant chain Pizza Express in the suburban town of Woking near London. Maitlis pointed out it was unusual that the prince remembered that particular occasion ""so specifically.""

Prince Andrew also said he had a medical condition that prevented him from sweating in response to Guiffre's claim that the prince was ""profusely sweating"" during their first encounter.

At the end of ""Scoop,"" ""Newsnight"" editor Esme Wren (played by Romolo Garai) tells her colleagues that Prince Andrew had stepped down from his royal duties following the backlash over the interview, which happened in real life.

A title card before the credits said Prince Andrew was stripped of his royal titles and paid £12 million ($16.3 million) to Giuffre in 2022 to settle a lawsuit she brought against him.

Giuffre sued Prince Andrew in 2021, leading him to lose his royal title.

On November 20, 2019, four days after the ""Newsnight"" interview aired, Prince Andrew announced that would be stepping away from his public royal duties.

""It has become clear to me over the last few days that the circumstances relating to my former association with Jeffrey Epstein has become a major disruption to my family's work and the valuable work going on in the many organizations and charities that I am proud to support,"" the statement read.

Referring to Queen Elizabeth II, who died in 2022, it went on: ""Therefore, I have asked Her Majesty if I may step back from public duties for the foreseeable future, and she has given her permission.""

He added: ""I continue to unequivocally regret my ill-judged association with Jeffrey Epstein. His suicide has left many unanswered questions, particularly for his victims, and I deeply sympathize with everyone who has been affected and wants some form of closure. I can only hope that, in time, they will be able to rebuild their lives. Of course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.""

But Prince Andrew's troubles did not end there. In August 2021, Giuffre sued the prince, accusing him of sexual assault. The prince denied the allegations.

After an unsuccessful attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, Queen Elizabeth stripped her son of his royal and military titles in January 2022, including ""His Royal Highness.""

A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace said in a statement sent to Business Insider in January 2022: ""With The Queen's approval and agreement, The Duke of York's military affiliations and Royal patronages have been returned to The Queen. The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen.""

Prince Andrew settled the lawsuit a month after losing his royal titles.

Prince Andrew and Giuffre reached a settlement in February 2022, Business Insider previously reported. In a statement attached to the settlement, Prince Andrew denied but agreed to donate an undisclosed sum to Giuffre's nonprofit to support victims of trafficking.

The Daily Telegraph, citing anonymous sources, reported in February 2022 that Prince Andrew paid around $16 million to Giuffre's non-profits as part of the settlement and would use funds given to him by the Queen.

Prince Andrew made his first public appearance after settling the lawsuit in March 2022 when he escorted Queen Elizabeth to a televised memorial service for her late husband, Prince Philip. However, his public appearances in the following years have been limited.

Last year, Prince Andrew attended the coronation of his brother, King Charles in May, but he missed the monarch's birthday parade and the royal family's remembrance day service.

Royal commentator Victoria Arbiter told Business Insider in January that the prince's ""public life"" was over.

But, in April, another royal commentator, Kristen Meinzer, told Business Insider that Prince Andrew could be staging a comeback after his appearances at the Royal Easter church service last week and King Constantine of Greece'se memorial service in February.

However, the release of ""Scoop"" and other documentaries about Prince Andrew means the public is unlikely to forget the 2019 scandal.

""The few times I’ve done investing, I’ve lost my shirt.”",https://fortune.com/2024/04/05/reed-hastings-index-funds-netflix-investor-stock-market-mutual-funds/,"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1235968427-e1712343797677.jpg?resize=1200,600",2024-04-05 19:38:08+00:00,"Netflix cofounder and executive chair Reed Hastings is a billionaire but admits he has trouble figuring out what to do with his money.

“The few times I’ve done investing, I’ve lost my shirt,” he said in an interview on podcast The Tim Ferriss Show.

Hastings, who has an estimated net worth around $6 billion, chalked up his poor track record to his demeanor, which he said isn’t ultimately well-suited to the world of investing.

“I realize I’m just so optimistic,” Hastings said. “Anybody who seems to have a good idea, I’m like, ‘Sure!’”

Hastings moved away from taking a more active hand in his investments when he realized his optimism meant he wasn’t wired the same way the best investors are. “It’s a different DNA than [what] differentially good investors have,” he noted.

Hastings said he’s learned his lesson and now relies on funds that keep pace with the market instead of trying to beat it, as well as his stake in the streamer he founded. “I’m a pure index-fund investor. I’m Netflix plus index funds,” he said.

According to SEC filings, Hastings owns about 3 million shares of Netflix stock valued around $1.9 billion at the time of publication.

One recent notable exception has been Hastings’s investment in Powder Mountain, which Fortune previously reported on. He bought the ski resort after the first group of investors failed to make good on their idea of turning it into the Burning Man of the slopes.

Otherwise, Hastings seems to have a rather traditional investment strategy of relying on index funds and company-granted stock options.

Index funds are safe investments in uncertain times

Index funds are investments that track a given benchmark, like the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones industrial average. They’re generally considered a safe way for investors to have their investments grow at the rate the market does. As Hastings’s remarks show, it can be very difficult for even the savviest person to beat the market.

Investors often put their money in index funds because they have a record of outperforming actively managed funds, where an expert picks what to invest in. A study from 2022 found that out of 2,132 actively managed mutual funds, not a single one outperformed its benchmark index. That’s been a consistent trend for years now among funds; 2023 marked the 14th consecutive year the majority of actively managed large-cap stock funds, which invest in companies with high market capitalizations, performed worse than the S&P 500.

That might explain why index funds have become so popular, even among institutional investors this year when economic forecasts are somewhat nebulous. There’s been chatter of a recession for almost two years now; the Fed still hasn’t offered firm commitments about interest rates; and who knows if the unemployment rate will remain steady? Meanwhile, markets are rallying, but many investors are unsure if gains will continue, while others are convinced they won’t.

Despite all those unknowns, the S&P 500—one of the most common benchmarks for index funds—has been up 27% over the past 12 months. Much of the S&P 500’s growth was powered by tech stocks, including Netflix. But there are indications it could start to broaden to other sectors, which would bolster investors’ portfolios.

Index funds’ critics say they concentrate too much power in too few people

The rise of index funds, first started by Vanguard in 1975, elevated a new type of finance executive, like BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. BlackRock, for example, manages $4.9 trillion dollars in its index funds, making it one of the major asset managers worldwide.

Index funds have also prompted a more theoretical debate over the structures of the market. Some contend that their effectiveness is proof of concept for “market socialism” because index funds feature common ownership of collective assets. Bloomberg opinion writer Matt Levine, who has covered index funds extensively, disputes the idea on the grounds that just because an index fund allows its investors to have collective ownership of a company, it doesn’t require they all own the same amount.

Another issue at the heart of the dispute over index funds is who exactly manages them. Supporters say that because they are passively managed without a portfolio manager or investment professional they cut out financial middlemen, reducing fees for everyday investors. Most index funds have fees, called expense ratios, that are below 1%. Still, critics say they’ve concentrated power in the hands of just a few companies—BlackRock and Vanguard among them. In a 2018 paper, Harvard law professor John Coates argued that only 12 people would ultimately make all the investment decisions regarding index funds. An analyst from Morningstar acknowledged that might be the case, but it hurts middlemen not retail investors. “Indexing has most substantially affected the financial-advice industry,” the analyst wrote.

Regardless of what happens to the index fund industry or to his specific investments in them, Hastings can always fall back on his Netflix shares. The stock is already up 35% this year, increasing Hastings’s net worth by about $496 million."

Blackwell has been candid about her approach to getting in shape, emphasizing that she doesn't push herself too hard at the gym or restrict her diet excessively. However, the Netflix celeb has adopted a few key practices that she attributes to her success. ""I stand by 'I love my body'... I've never been a small girl my entire life and I'm OK with that.

Among the changes she's made, Blackwell mentioned practicing intermittent fasting and maintaining a diet rich in protein, fruits, and vegetables. Additionally, she aims to drink 90 ounces of water a day and commits to 45-minute walks.

""I feel better. I feel like my skin feels better. I look better,"" she said in the TikTok, reflecting on the positive impacts of these lifestyle adjustments. ""And I'm able to deliver my best possible self to everyone else around me.""

Netflix is known for paying top dollar to secure the best employees — and demanding a huge amount from its workers.

Reed Hastings, the streaming giant's cofounder and executive chair, walked through five key elements of Netflix's corporate culture on the latest episode of ""The Tim Ferriss Show.""

The tech billionaire, who stepped down as Netflix's joint CEO early last year, discussed having sky-high standards, finding and removing merely adequate performers, chasing down references, and insisting people speak up.

Here are the five topics he tackled:

Advertisement

1. Team, not family

Netflix is run like a top-tier sports team that aims to fill each position with the best person who's also a team player, Hastings said.

Stacking its roster with exceptional performers maximizes Netflix's chance of success and also motivates, educates, and draws in even more talent.

It's ""the energy driver because everyone around you is amazing, you learn so much, you attract other amazing people,"" Hastings said.

2. Goodbye gift

Netflix strives to root out mediocrity, but marries its Darwinian demand for excellence with some degree of humanity.

Advertisement

""The reward for adequate performance is a generous severance package,"" Hastings said.

""We want people to feel like, 'I'm trying really hard and I'm gonna give my all and if it doesn't work out, I've got a parachute.'""

Netflix offers a minimum of four months' severance in the US and above-average packages in other countries. The policy makes it less wrenching for bosses to cull so-so performers.

Related stories

""The fact that there's a big severance package makes it easier for the manager to cut that person and try to find someone else who will be a rock star in that role,"" Hastings said.

Advertisement

3. Hunting down references

Netflix makes sure to recruit the best by not just calling the references they provide, but also finding other people who know the potential hire.

Hastings usually starts with a LinkedIn search for mutual connections who are closer to him than the prospective employee so they're more likely to be upfront with him. He likes to speak with them using video chat for one big reason.

""When someone's on Zoom they're much less likely to lie to me,"" he said. ""I can ask a couple questions and they don't feel like it's being recorded and so it creates an appropriate intimacy but also a semi-anonymity.""

4. Keeping or letting go

Netflix encourages its managers to take the ""keeper test"" once every quarter or so, Hastings said.

Advertisement

For each of their reports, managers ask themselves if the person was quitting to work somewhere else, would they try to change the individual's mind and fight to keep them, or be fine with them departing.

""If we wouldn't fight to keep someone, we should proactively give them a generous severance package and try to find someone that we might well fight to keep,"" Hastings said.

5. Open and honest

""To disagree silently is disloyal,"" Hastings said.

He explained that most people are brought up to be polite and agreeable, and mostly aim to please their manager and defer to their decisions.

Advertisement

But when a worker sees the company is doing something wrong, holding their tongue to avoid confrontation or angering the higher ups can lead to bigger, more entrenched problems and stall the forward progress of the business.

Netflix tries to avoid that issue by encouraging ""radical candor"" across its workforce, and pushing bosses to ""farm for dissent"" or seek out opposing views to their own.

""Sometimes if to help them grow I've got to be willing to argue with my manager, then that's okay,"" Hastings said."

The Duke of York was later photographed on Friday looking relaxed in his black Range Rover driving down the Long Walk on the Windsor estate when he nearly ran over a dog. A passer-by's dog ran in front of the 4×4 as pedestrians alerted the Duke to the hazard, who appeared to laugh.

The company supplies small solar powered water pumps, the cost of which is subsidized by the sale of carbon credits, to small-scale farmers, allowing them to replace diesel-powered pumps in some cases and boost yields in fields that weren’t previously irrigated.

SunCulture operates in Kenya, Uganda and Ivory Coast and has distribution agreements in Ethiopia, Zambia and Togo.

“SunCulture helps farmers grow more food, which is exactly the kind of business that prospers,” Hastings said in comments supplied by the irrigation company.

The startup estimates that of the 700 million Africans living on small-holder farms only 4% have access to irrigation, meaning that they have significantly lower yields and are vulnerable to dry weather.

The company has sold 47,000 units, powered by solar panels that can be mounted on small buildings or shacks and in some cases batteries. They use as little as 310 watts of power, equivalent to that needed for about five standard size incandescent light bulbs.

“We’re the largest small-holder solar irrigation company in Africa. We use financial services and carbon revenues to make the cost of solar irrigation 50% cheaper than diesel and petrol pumps,” said Samir Ibrahim, SunCulture’s chief executive officer. “Irrigation is just like old very unsexy technology but it could increase your yields by up to five times.”"

Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, and Prince Harry are continuing their work with Netflix.

The streaming giant confirmed to CNN on Thursday that the couple’s Archewell Productions has two new nonfiction series in production at Netflix as part of a multi-year overall deal signed in 2020.

The news was first reported by Deadline.

The first series will be curated by Meghan and “will celebrate the joys of cooking & gardening, entertaining, and friendship” according to Netflix.

It comes on the heels of the announcement of another new business venture of hers, an apparent lifestyle brand named the American Riviera Orchard.

The second new series is, according to Netflix, “shot primarily at the US Open Polo Championship in Wellington, Florida, will provide viewers unprecedented access to the world of professional polo.”

Both shows are in early stages of production and their titles and release dates will be released at a later date.

Netflix has already worked with the couple on three other nonfiction series, including “Harry & Meghan” which peeled back the curtain on their relationship with the royal family and their move to the US after they stepped down from their royal duties.

The company also produced for the streaming giant “Live To Lead,” an interview series featuring world leaders, and the “Heart of Invictus,” a documentary series about the event and organization whose founding patron is Prince Harry."

The as-yet untitled project announcement comes just weeks after the Duchess of Sussex soft-launched her new lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard, which is set to sell a range of home products. Newsweek approached representatives of Meghan Markle via email for comment.

Whether the program will tie in with the brand hasn't yet been confirmed, but trademark applications show that the American Riviera Orchard name has been protected in connection with products such as: stationery; tablewear; jams, jellies and nut butters; yoga mats; gardening accessories; pet food, and much more.

An announcement made through the sussex.com website on Thursday confirmed Meghan's new show, as well as a second project that will provide audiences with a behind-the-scenes look into the world of competitive polo. The elite sport is one to which Prince Harry has long been connected, playing often alongside his father, King Charles III, and brother, the Prince of Wales, throughout his youth.

The announcement said that the Sussexes' Archewell Productions company was ""pleased"" to share details of the new projects, providing an enticing glimpse into what audiences can expect from Meghan's focused offering.

What Is Meghan Markle's New Show About?

On April 11, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's Archewell Productions company announced two new projects, one of which it has been revealed will focus primarily on the duchess' lifestyle interests.

The announcement said that the series will be ""curated"" by Meghan and will focus on being a celebration of the ""joys of cooking & gardening, entertaining, and friendship.""

What Is Meghan's New Show Called?

Details of Meghan's new show are limited, including the project's name. It is possible that the series could in some way be linked to the duchess' recently launched lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard. However, this has not been confirmed.

When Will Meghan's New Show Be Released?

The Archewell Productions announcement of Meghan and Harry's new Netflix projects said that both series were in ""various stages of production and their titles and release dates will be announced in the coming months.""

A report from Deadline says that the shows are in ""early stages"" of production, which means fans could be waiting some time for them to hit screens. In the past, Harry and Meghan have faced criticism online for their delivery time on announced projects.

In 2021, the couple said that they would be releasing the docuseries Heart of Invictus as their first project under a multimillion-dollar content-creation deal with Netflix, signed when they split from the monarchy. The series did not hit screens until the summer of 2023.

Who Is Producing Meghan's New Netflix Show?

Archewell Productions will produce Meghan's new show for Netflix in partnership with The Intellectual Property Corporation (IPC)—a division of Sony Pictures Television.

IPC has produced a number of popular non-scripted television projects, including: Secrets of Playboy (A&E); Selena + Chef (Max & Food Network); and Leah Remini: Scientology & the Aftermath (A&E).

Tired of seeing the same action movie on Netflix over and over? Netflix knows, and they're working on it.

High-octane action films backed by big-name casts have dominated Netflix in recent years. Dan Lin, the company's new film chief, now wants to change that, according to The New York Times.

It might have something to do with Mark Wahlberg.

Related stories

In 2020, Netflix paid Wahlberg a whopping $30 million to star in ""Spenser Confidential,"" which clocks in at 24 on the highest-paid film roles of all time. Critics panned the action thriller, an adaptation of Robert P. Barker's 2013 novel ""Wonderland."" It scored a dismal 36% on Rotten Tomatoes despite the hefty investment.

Netflix appears to want to learn from that lesson.

Netflix's previous film chief, Scott Stuber, left the company in January following clashes with bosses over what kinds of films to produce.

Before Stuber's exit, Netflix Chief Content Officer Bela Bajaria met with the company's film department, where she said film quality needed to improve, according to the Times. In the meeting, Bajaria told staff that the company was moving in a new direction and to consider leaving if they were not on board, according to the outlet.

Lin is now tasked with producing a wider variety of films, which the company thinks can be done at a lower budget, to connect better with the site's audience, the Times reported. One of his first moves was putting an end to massive upfront paychecks for actors.

Lin quickly went to work reorganizing the company's film department, laying off 15 of its 150 film department staff, and reorganizing the department by budget rather than genre, according to the outlet. Lin also ""indicated that Netflix is no longer only the home of expensive action flicks featuring big movie stars.""

The company is now emphasizing its own producers, who it expects to become ""more aggressive"" at developing their own concepts instead of waiting for other producers to bring in big deals, the Times reported.

Netflix did not immediately return a request for comment from Business Insider on Sunday."

The Duke and Duchess of Sussex drew a crowd of media and the wealthy on Friday as he played in a celebrity pro-am polo match to benefit Sentebale, the charity he founded in 2006 for children and young adults who live in the southern Africa countries of Lesotho and Botswana.

Harry, Meghan and their friend, Argentine polo player and model Nacho Figueras, were tailed by a camera crew from the same production company that makes the soccer reality show “Welcome to Wrexham” for an upcoming Netflix miniseries that will focus on polo.

Harry did not speak to reporters. But Figueras said he hopes the show will have the same impact for polo that “Formula 1: Drive to Survive” had for the worldwide auto racing circuit. Harry and Meghan will serve as executive producers.

“We have been working on this for a long time. It was always Harry’s dream and passion to share with the world it takes to be a really competitive polo player at the highest level,” Figueras said.

Figueras, who captained one of the two teams that played the prince’s squad, said before the abbreviated matches he and Harry gave each other a lot of ribbing in recent days over Friday’s competition. They have worked together on Sentebale since 2007.

“We joke a lot about who is going to win,” Figueras said. Harry, he said, is “a very good rider, he’s a very good athlete, he has great eye-hand coordination. He’s very competitive. He’s a very good polo player.”

In Friday’s matches at Grand Champions Polo Club in suburban Palm Beach County, Harry’s Royal Salute Sentebale team beat Figueras’ squad 3-1, with the prince scoring the opening goal. He picked up the ball at midfield — 150 yards (137 meters) from the goal — and repeatedly hammered it the rest of the way, popping it through the goal posts. He also stopped his friend from a possible breakaway, though he let out a loud yelp of frustration when he missed a pass to a teammate that could have led to a goal.

In his first match of the day against Maseru Team, Royal Sentebale won 1-0, but the prince missed an open, in-close shot.

With Sentebale winning both matches, Harry received the trophy for winning the mini-tournament — and a kiss on the cheek — from Meghan.

About 300 spectators attended the matches, part of a fundraising weekend that will raise $1 million for Sentebale, organizers said. Since 2006, celebrity polo matches around the world have raised about $15 million for the charity, organizers said. According to its latest annual report, Sentabale raised about $6 million overall in its 2022 fiscal year, with about half that coming from the United States.

Harry has been estranged for several years from members of his family, including his older brother, Prince William, heir to the throne. Any rift was further exacerbated by his 2023 memoir “Spare,” which recounted sibling grievances including a time he said his brother ripped his necklace and knocked him onto a dog bowl.

Harry quit royal duties in 2020, and he and Meghan moved to Los Angeles, citing what they said was the unbearable intrusions and racist attitudes of the British media.

Before marrying the prince in a royal wedding watched around the world in 2018, the 42-year-old duchess was a star of the TV show “Suits.” The couple has two children, 4-year-old Archie and 2-year-old Lilibet."

The movie marks the directorial debut for the comedian.

Seinfeld claimed all the way back in 2018 that he had been “thinking about an invention of the Pop-Tart movie. Imagine the drunk on sugar-power Kellogg’s cereal culture of the mid-60s in Battle Creek, (Michigan) That’s a vibe I could work with.”

The movie, co-written by Seinfeld, stars Seinfeld along with Jim Gaffigan, Melissa McCarthy, Amy Schumer, Hugh Grant, James Marsden, Bill Burr, Fred Armisen, Dan Levy and others. “Unfrosted” tells the tale of 1963 Michigan, the year before Pop-Tarts hit grocery store shelves.

“Making a movie about Pop-Tarts has led to so many wonderful, unexpected surprises, and as a car guy, I honestly cannot believe our film’s logo will be on an IndyCar entry this weekend,” Seinfeld said. “I am grateful to Chip Ganassi Racing for making this happen, and honored to be affiliated with The American Legion and the work they do to support American Veterans.”

The American Legion signed off on the promotion as part of its “Be the One” mission that aims to save the lives of veterans by raising awareness, destigmatizing mental-health treatment and educating veterans, service members and their loved ones about what to do when a person appears at risk of suicide. Comedy is often used as a way to alleviate the symptoms that can lead to thoughts of suicide."

But their track record is terrible.",https://www.businessinsider.com/meghan-markle-prince-harry-new-netflix-shows-suits-spotify-deal-2024-4,https://i.insider.com/661ed39349058e669356af02?width=1200&format=jpeg,2024-04-18 09:47:01+00:00,"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seem like lovely people. Despite some harrowing experiences throughout their love story, they appear to be well-meaning, and they have two very cute kids. All in all, they're … fine. They are also incredibly famous. But this combination of decency and notoriety does not necessarily translate to them being great business people or top-notch media moguls, as evidenced by companies throwing millions of dollars at them, with, let's say, mixed results.

Netflix announced on April 11 that two new shows from the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are in the early stages of production. The first will be a series ""curated"" by Meghan that, according to its vague logline, ""celebrates the joys of cooking, gardening, entertaining, and friendship."" The second will be about professional polo, shot at a championship in Florida. Film crews followed Harry around playing in a polo match this month.

These productions are part of the deal the pair signed with the streaming platform in 2020, reportedly worth $100 million. It has resulted in some hits, or rather, a hit: a multipart documentary called ""Harry and Meghan"" about the duo's romance, turbulence with the royal family, and their move to the US. It became Netflix's most-watched documentary debut. (If you haven't seen it, the early episodes are quite good, in my opinion, but by the end it drags.)

H&M's deal with Netflix has also produced some misses. Netflix dropped ""Pearl,"" an animated children's series Meghan created through her and Harry's production company, Archewell Productions, before it even premiered. Netflix executives reportedly turned on the idea because they figured kids wouldn't really care who made the show, even if she was a duchess. Two other documentary series the pair put out on Netflix, ""Heart of Invictus"" and ""Live to Lead,"" didn't break through. The Wall Street Journal reported in 2023 that Netflix had also rejected at least two TV ideas from Meghan and Harry and that the company was unlikely to renew their deal with them in 2025. Netflix did not return a request for comment for this story.

Despite the misfires, Netflix is having a better time with the couple than Spotify. The audio-streaming company signed a deal with Harry and Meghan in 2020 reportedly worth $20 million. After a long stretch of radio silence, the couple finally came out with ""Archetypes"" in 2022, a 12-episode podcast hosted by Meghan about women and ""the labels that try to hold women back."" In 2023, Spotify and the royal couple said they had agreed to part ways. The pair reportedly didn't get paid the full $20 million because they didn't produce enough content.

After four years outside the official orbit of the royal family, as The WSJ notes, the documentary and Harry's memoir ""Spare"" are the only impactful things Harry and Meghan have produced. It's hard not to look at all of this and say, OK, Harry and Meghan seem nice, but if I ran a company, I probably would not be making big deals with them.

The $100 million at the time sounded like a good idea, and who knew that the two of them would be such duds on camera?

While Spotify has already washed its hands of the Sussexes, Netflix is still trying to work with them. As Michael Pachter, a managing director at Wedbush Securities who's covered movies, entertainment, and tech for two decades, explained, it's because they've still got that $100 million deal. It's one of many such agreements Netflix signed with big names when it was trying to better establish itself and get eyeballs, including with Barack and Michelle Obama, Ryan Murphy, and Shonda Rhimes.

""The $100 million at the time sounded like a good idea, and who knew that the two of them would be such duds on camera?"" Pachter said.

It's possible one or both shows could take off like their personal documentary did. There's still juice in the Meghan and Harry storyline. Netflix may be hoping there'll be some halo effect from ""Suits,"" the 2010s-era legal drama Markle was in that recently became a Netflix hit.

The shows being proposed now will likely be relatively inexpensive to make — it's not wildly costly to pay a camera crew to film Harry playing polo or Meghan cooking something in her kitchen (if that's what her show turns out to be). Productivity prospects may be better here because Meghan and Harry won't really have to do much of anything extra except exist as themselves. Harry won't need to come up with a podcast concept, which he reportedly struggled to do with Spotify — he just has to ride a horse. And maybe just keeping on good terms with the Sussexes is worth it in case more drama erupts from the royal family. Perhaps Prince Harry decides to try to get back into the royal fold and documents that. A public breakup with Meghan and Harry may also be a mess Netflix doesn't want to deal with.

But barring some juicy new development or a sudden turnaround in viewer interest, Netflix could decide to throw in the towel, but unlike Spotify, the streamer might not be able to recoup any of the $100 million from the Sussexes.

""Netflix can cancel this anytime they want and just pay them the unpaid amount,"" Pachter said. ""And maybe they will do that if they keep messing around with the formula and can't find anything. They're not going to waste their time if nobody watches it.""

The what-to-do-with-Meghan-and-Harry issue is also illustrative of a broader point: Celebrity-driven media is a tough business. Plenty of people are famous for one thing — acting, singing, being good at a sport, being born into a very wealthy British family that happens to own a lot of land and jewels — and then have a hard time parlaying that into something different. It feels like nearly every celebrity has a podcast, but only a handful have broken through — like ""SmartLess,"" hosted by Jason Bateman, Will Arnett, and Sean Hayes, or Joe Rogan's show. The list of stars turned failed talk-show hosts is endless and includes Magic Johnson and Chevy Chase.

Working out which celebrities can cross over is hard, and there's no clear formula that guarantees success. If there were, everyone would be implementing it.

Media companies founded by Reese Witherspoon and LeBron James have had some successes, but they haven't been guaranteed hit factories. In the 1990s and early 2000s, a number of Hollywood studios' so-called ""vanity deals"" with celebrity-backed productions flopped or were canned, including with stars such as Alicia Silverstone, Nicolas Cage, and Demi Moore. More recently, the Obamas have received multiple accolades for some of their productions, though they haven't hit a bunch of commercial home runs. Just this week, CNN canceled its fairly new talk show with Gayle King and Charles Barkley.

Working out which celebrities can cross over is hard, and there's no clear formula that guarantees success. If there were, everyone would be implementing it.

Despite their trials and tribulations, Meghan and Harry are still at it. Archewell Productions continues to exist. Meghan is launching some sort of lifestyle venture called American Riviera Orchard that, so far, is mainly a website and an Instagram account. She's filed a number of trademark applications that would indicate she may plan to dip into skincare, cosmetics, yoga mats, and accessories for pets. The former actor has experience in the lifestyle space — in her previous life, she ran a blog called The TIG. This week, the brand released its first product — 50 jars of jam sent to Meghan's friends. Is Meghan Markle the new J.M. Smucker? Sure, maybe, and then she can show everyone how she made that jam on her hit Netflix show.

So why is it changing its model? | CNN Business,"Netflix, the dominant player in streaming, is expected to announce its first-quarter results on Thursday after enjoying months as a Wall Street darling.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/18/business/netflix-earnings-first-quarter-preview/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1237871004.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2024-04-18 11:48:52+00:00,"CNN —

Last year, Netflix made a particularly risky bet by pushing users who share passwords to create their own accounts — but it’s paid off.

Netflix, the dominant player in streaming, added more than 9 million subscribers in the first three months of the year, hitting a record high of 269.6 million subscribers.

“It added more subscribers than many analysts, myself included, expected,” said eMarketer senior analyst Ross Benes. “This signals that password sharing was even more common than previously thought as Netflix keeps converting freeloader viewers into paid users.”

While the subscriber additions topped Wall Street’s estimates, the company still reported a drop in growth from its blowout fourth-quarter report, when Netflix added 13 million subscribers. Netflix announced Thursday that it plans to stop sharing its quarterly subscriber numbers in 2025.

The company also reported $9.37 billion in revenue and earnings per share of $5.28 for the first quarter, beating Wall Street’s estimates, according to FactSet.

However, the stock, which has been a darling of Wall Street this year, fell in after-hours trading.

Much of the company’s past growth and success, analysts say, has come from its old, well-established business model. In recent months, Netflix has made moves to expand and even radically reinvent its business in an effort to juice profit.

While streaming competitors like Disney+, Hulu, Max (owned by CNN’s parent company Warner Bros. Discovery) and Peacock work to draw in subscribers with original programming, Netflix has made big bets lately in live sports, video games, and in deals to license other providers’ content — all while transitioning from an advertising-free subscription service to a full-blown ad-supported juggernaut.

Netflix’s reinvention

For Netflix, last month’s Oscars were a disappointment: Though the streaming service led its rivals in nominations, it took home just one award, for best live-action short film. Going forward, the company seems to be moving away from what it was known for: spending its money on developing the big-budget films and TV shows able to win those awards.

The company’s first-quarter letter to shareholders laid out several goals to “sustain healthy growth long term,” including: “Improve the variety and quality of our entertainment — with more great TV shows and movies, a stronger slate of games and must-watch live programming.”

In recent months, after “Suits” exploded in popularity on the platform, Netflix has indicated that it plans to license more content from other studios. New generations are rediscovering iconic shows from the 90s and the early aughts, like “Seinfeld” and “Sex and the City” after they show up on Netflix’s platform.

“They’re getting tons of viewership on both original content and licensed content,” Alicia Reese, an equity analyst who covers Netflix for Wedbush Securities, said. “It’s productive and it’s cheaper for them.”

Netflix has also expanded into live and sports programming this year, encroaching on traditional TV’s domain. In February, Netflix aired its first-ever awards show, the Screen Actors’ Guild Awards, and announced a 10-year deal to air “WWE Raw” live, valued at more than $5 billion.

In January, Netflix announced it had acquired the exclusive rights to ""WWE Raw"" live, currently seen on Comcast's USA cable network. According to a company filing, the 10-year deal is valued at more than $5 billion. WWE/Getty Images

In the fight for eyeballs, Netflix has gotten creative, partnering with Rockstar Games’ “Grand Theft Auto,” the wildly popular action-adventure video game franchise, to further push into the video game space.

“We’re stoked by the performance of GTA,” Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters said in January. “We were in the top mobile game downloads for several weeks, which shows it was not only big for us, but big numbers for mobile gaming in general.”

Reese has faith in Netflix’s new direction.

“Netflix has that winning formula right now,” she said. “They have a lot of content of various types that keep people using the service at various price points.”

TV with ads, again

Reese said she believes Netflix also has other avenues of growth including the company’s newer advertising-supported subscription tier.

Since the start of this year, Netflix has released several shows that have generated excitement among fans, including the live-action “Avatar: The Last Airbender."" Robert Falconer/Netflix

The ad tier, which costs $6.99 per month in the United States, significantly less than Netflix’s other subscription plans, has seen explosive growth since it was introduced in late 2022, according to the company. In January, Netflix’s president of advertising, Amy Reinhard, shared that Netflix’s ad-tier had more than 23 million users.

While the company did not share an updated number of ad-tier users, in Thursday’s shareholder letter, Netflix said its ads membership grew 65% quarter-over-quarter.

Reese said Netflix’s future growth could hinge on its success in the advertising space.

In January, Peters said the company aimed to snatch more ad dollars from traditional TV competitors.

“We know ad dollars follow engagement. We’ve got the most engaged audience so we believe we’re well positioned to capture some of that ad spend that shifts from linear to streaming,” he said.

On the company’s earnings call, Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters discussed the company’s decision to stop sharing quarterly paid subscriber numbers beginning in 2025.

“We’ve evolved, and we’re going to continue to evolve, developing our revenue model and adding things like advertising and our extra member features. Things that aren’t directly connected to number of members,” he said. “So, each incremental member has a different business impact.”

Benes from eMarketer, said Netflix’s decision to stop sharing subscriber numbers allows the company to “quit while its ahead and go out as the world heavyweight champ in subscribers”

“Netflix is emphasizing what benefits them,” Benes said. “The password sharing boosts will eventually recede and it will be very difficult to continue to add as many subscribers as they have added in the last few quarters.”"

Article content Expectations for Netflix’s first quarter had soared in recent days, as one analyst after another published rosy forecasts. And while Netflix did indeed beat those expectations, posting its best start to the year since 2020, it signaled a more temperate pace of growth ahead. In its letter to investors Thursday, the company said subscriber gains will be lower this period, while revenue will increase 16%. Netflix also said it will stop reporting paid quarterly membership and revenue per subscriber, starting the first quarter of next year. Those metrics have long been the primary way Wall Street evaluated the company’s performance, but Netflix has tried to shift the focus to traditional measures like sales and profit. Management will continue to report major subscriber milestones. “The movement to no longer disclose quarterly subscriptions from next year will not go down well,” Paolo Pescatore, founder and analyst at PP Foresight, said in an email. “More so given the subscriber growth that the streaming king has seen over the last year.” Netflix has rebounded from a slowdown in 2021 and 2022 to grow at its fastest rate since the early days of the coronavirus pandemic. That is due in large part to its crackdown on people who were using someone else’s account. The company estimated more than 100 million people were using an account for which they didn’t pay. While executives at Netflix feared a backlash from customers, the company has been able to convince millions of moochers to pay for access.

Article content The company added 9.33 million customers in the first quarter of 2024, according to a statement Thursday, nearly doubling the 4.84 million average of analysts’ estimates. Netflix attracted new customers from all over the world, thanks to a strong slate of original programs, showing particular strength in the US and Canada. Those new subscribers helped the company beat forecasts for sales and earnings as well. Those new customers have had plenty to watch. Netflix has delivered a new hit every couple weeks so far this year, including limited series such as Fool Me Once and Griselda, the dramas The Gentleman and 3 Body Problem and the reality show Love Is Blind. The streaming service accounts for about 8% of TV viewing in the US — and is a leading TV network in most of the world’s major media markets. “With more than two people per household on average, we have an audience of over half a billion people,” the company said in its letter. “No entertainment company has ever programmed at this scale and with this ambition before.” The recent growth has lifted Netflix shares back toward record highs, giving the company a market value of more than $260 billion. It set an all-time closing high of $691.69 in November 2021.

Article content Some analysts worry that Netflix is once again trading at a valuation that far exceeds the fundamentals of the business. The company delivered sales of $9.33 billion, rising 15% and beating estimates of $9.26 billion. Net income grew to $2.33 billion, or $5.28 a share, also above projections. Those figures are below companies with smaller market values, the boost from the crackdown on account sharing is temporary and Netflix executives have been reluctant to put a firm timetable on when that growth would stop. Read More: Netflix Valuation Is No House of Cards Yet even skeptical analysts have been impressed with the company’s recent performance, lifting their price targets for investors. To sustain its growth going forward, Netflix has also introduced a cheaper, advertising-supported version of its service targeting cost-conscious customers. It’s also begun to invest in live programming, including stand-up specials, wrestling and an upcoming boxing match. About 40% of Netflix’s new customers are selecting the advertising option in markets where it’s available, the company said. The advertising tier is still minuscule relative to online video giants like YouTube.

For years, Netflix investors cared about one thing more than anything else: Go-go growth, which they measured by the number of subscribers the streaming company signed up.

Now, those investors are going to have to live without that data.

Starting next year, Netflix will stop releasing subscriber statistics on a regular basis, the company announced. Instead, it said in an investor letter, it will ""announce major subscriber milestones as we cross them.""

It's a major shift in how the company interacts with Wall Street. And it comes on the same day that the company announced a huge boost in subscribers: Netflix said it added 9.3 million paying users in the last quarter — about 4 million more than the average Wall Street forecast.

Advertisement

What's the rationale for the change?

Netflix says it's because it no longer thinks subscriber growth is a good way to understand the company's progress — something it has been saying for some time in its investor letters.

Related stories

Here's the explanation in their words:

""In our early days, when we had little revenue or profit, membership growth was a strong indicator of our future potential. But now we're generating very substantial profit and free cash flow (FCF). We are also developing new revenue streams like advertising and our extra member feature, so memberships are just one component of our growth. In addition, as we've evolved our pricing and plans from a single to multiple tiers with different price points depending on the country, each incremental paid membership has a very different business impact.""

To push that point across, last year, Netflix stopped providing quarterly guidance on subscriber growth. But analysts still created their own estimates. But starting in the first quarter of next year, that's all going to grind to a halt.

Netflix shares are down a bit after the news — which could simply be a reaction to the fact that Netflix stock has been on a tear for some time, so even wowza numbers aren't enough to wow investors right now.

Will Netflix be able to crush it in the future?

But it's also understandable if investors think Netflix is going to stop providing subscriber numbers because the numbers aren't going to be as impressive in the future.

Which, really, is a proxy for the main question about Netflix for a very long time: Just how big can the company get?

Today, Netflix has nearly 270 million paid subscribers around the world, which makes it much, much bigger than its peers. But for the past few years, investors have wondered if Netflix might be stalling — either because of competition from the likes of Disney, or because there simply may not be as many people interested in paying for videos, period.

Advertisement

That's why Netflix's admission that it lost a million subscribers two years ago shook the entire media world and had everyone asking — was that a Netflix problem or a Streaming problem?

Since then, investors have stopped telling would-be Netflix rivals to grow at all costs, and have started pushing them to worry about profits, not subscriber numbers (this also, not coincidentally, synced with the end of zero interest rates, which changed the way most investors viewed most companies, period).

Netflix now looks well set up to live in that world, too: After burning money for years as it built up its streaming business, it is now consistently profitable — this quarter, it earned an eye-popping $2.3 billion on revenue of $9.4 billion, though some of that seems due to one-time accounting issues.

Will that satisfy investors? On the one hand — it's going to take some getting used to, and plenty of people will reasonably be asking why now? On the other: There really aren't any rules about how this stuff works — which is why Google/Alphabet has provided next-to-no information about its business forever and has been rewarded with sky-high stock for most of that time. Let's see if it works for Netflix."

Netflix said it grew subscribers by 9.33 million worldwide in Q1 — double what Wall Street had expected.

Boosting its performance was the company's crackdown on password sharing, which has led to new signups, as well as its cheaper, ad-supported option. The ads tier costs less ($6.99 per month) than adding a member outside your household ($7.99 per month).

The sport is played on horseback, with smaller ponies chosen for their agility and speed on the field as opposing teams attempt to hit a single ball into their rivals' goal using long, wooden mallets.

Polo is best known for being a favored sport of royals such as Harry, Prince William and King Charles. There is an elite and exclusive social scene, with some games being sponsored or held to raise funds for charity.

Polo has long been criticized by animal-rights campaigners, alongside other equine sports, owing to the high risk of injury to the ponies involved; the animals face the danger of suffering broken legs and being struck by mallets during play. Harry's decision therefore to base a new high-profile docuseries around the sport leaves him open to criticism.

Newsweek approached representatives of Prince Harry via email for comment.

When asked by Newsweek for their reaction to the Archewell Productions polo show announcement, a representative of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) said the nonprofit organization is trying to encourage people away from the sport.

""Polo involves many of the harsh practices horses are prominently subjected to in the horseracing world, including the use of whips that sting and sharp metal spurs that dig into their sides,"" PETA's Vice President of Programmes and Operations Elisa Allen told Newsweek.

""Horses are accidentally hit in the head or jaw with the mallet and sustain ankle injuries from being yanked forcefully to make sharp turns and driven hard by competitive, aggressive riders. Once horses are considered 'used up,' just like those used for racing, many are killed, discarded, or sent off to slaughter.

""PETA encourages polo enthusiasts to take up water polo or another harmless hobby involving only willing participants instead,"" Allen said.

This is not the first time Harry's involvement in the sport has generated criticism. In 2010, it was reported that one of the prince's favorite ponies, named Drizzle, died of a heart attack after being retired midgame. At the time, PETA said the death was ""by no means an isolated incident"" in polo.

""Yet again this shows that whenever animals are exploited for 'sport,' their welfare comes in a distant third behind winning and making money,"" PETA said in a press release.

Harry's new project for Netflix was announced on April 11 by Archewell Productions, the company started by Harry and Meghan when they split from the monarchy in 2020.

The company announced two new shows, one ""curated"" by Meghan based on her love of entertaining, and another based on Harry's personal passion, polo.

The show, Archewell Productions said, would be ""shot primarily at the US Open Polo Championship in Wellington, Florida at The USPA National Polo Center, and in partnership with Boardwalk Pictures, will provide viewers with unprecedented access to the world of professional polo.""

""Known primarily for its aesthetic and social scene,"" the announcement added. ""The series will pull the curtain back on the grit and passion of the sport, capturing players and all it takes to compete at the highest level.""

Harry and Meghan hit the ground running after the announcement was made, appearing at the Royal Salute Polo Challenge at the Grand Champions Polo Club in Florida on April 12. The prince was photographed with a film crew in the state the next day.

No release date or title for the polo project has yet been released. Reports suggest both Harry and Meghan's new shows are in the early stages of production.

But the stock is slated to sell off on Friday after the world’s most valuable entertainment company shocked the market with news it would soon cease updating investors every quarter on how many customers subscribe to the streaming giant.

“Ultimately we think this is a better approach that reflects the evolution of the business,” co-CEO Greg Peters said on Thursday, adding the decision was “consistent with how we manage internally to engagement, revenue, and profit.”

Investors fear it may be linked to last year’s password-sharing crackdown, which—together with its push into a new advertising-supported subscriber tier—has driven its remarkable growth of late.

Since the initiative began to affect results in the latter half of 2023, that means year-on-year comparisons will soon switch from tailwinds to headwinds. The bulk of the low-hanging fruit has already been harvested, leaving only a few quarters of increasingly diminishing returns.

It is possible Netflix expects U.S. subscriptions could start to decline next year, something it first saw back in 2019 before the pandemic supercharged demand. Markets didn’t digest the news well at the time, and shares are now set to open 5% lower when trading begins later today.

“What is really spooking the Street right now,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior media analyst Geetha Ranganathan told Yahoo Finance, “is that they are going to stop issuing any type of subscriber metric starting from the first quarter of 2025, and I think people generally view that as growth kind of plateauing.”

Netflix only testing the waters in live sports

The industry is currently going through a shakeout as both linear and digital TV have their own specific sets of problems. Paramount is looking to sell itself, while Disney evaluates which assets it should offload to fund its loss-making streaming service and, with it, eventually earn double-digit margins in future.

Netflix, however, has already long since reached the promised land. On the back of subscriber numbers that exceeded Street estimates by roughly 5 million and a 25% operating margin target for 2024, Deutsche Bank hiked its estimates for revenue, operating profit, and free cash flow—and with it the price target on the stock to $575, up from a previous $550.

Going forward, however, investors are asking themselves what will drive earnings growth once the effects from the crackdown on password sharing and expansion into ad-supported subscriptions begins to peter out.

One solution has been pivoting to live sports, an area long dominated by Disney’s ESPN and that comes with the kind of built-in audiences attractive to advertisers.

With the help of its deep-pocketed parent, Amazon, Prime Video struck first in 2021, inking a deal to show Thursday night NFL games for a reported $1 billion per year.

By comparison, Netflix has only begun dipping in its toes to test the waters, signing a deal to show the Mike Tyson bout with Jake Paul as well as bring wrestling matches from WWE Raw to the platform come next year.

Investor Deepwater Asset Management argued this won’t be nearly enough, however, and warned that the kind of heavy spending Netflix will need to secure streaming rights will almost certainly dilute its profitability.

“If it’s kind of these one-off sporting events—or eclectic sporting events like wrestling, NASCAR, things like that—I don’t think that’s going to move the needle,” Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater, told CNBC. “They got to get into some mainstream sports, and that’s going to be an impact on margins.”"

Netflix crushed Wall Street estimates on Thursday when it reported its first-quarter earnings results, but investors remained unconvinced.

Shares fell as much as 9% on Friday as investors focused not on the positives from the quarter, but instead on the announcement that Netflix would stop sharing subscriber growth data beginning in 2025. The decision is worrying some who are interpreting the decision as a signal the company is bracing for limited growth in future subscriber additions.

""We view the lack of visibility into these key KPIs as a contributor to the negative after-market stock reaction,"" Bank of America said. ""While still early, the potential concern is subscriber growth had significantly decelerated in 2022 (prior to the implementation of paid sharing), and this could be a harbinger of decelerating subscriber growth in the future.""

Here are the key results:

Revenue: $9.37 billion, versus analyst estimates of $9.28 billion

$9.37 billion, versus analyst estimates of $9.28 billion Earnings per share: $5.28, versus analyst estimates of $4.52

$5.28, versus analyst estimates of $4.52 Subscriber adds: 9.3 million, versus analyst estimates of 5 million

Netflix also increased its second-quarter revenue and profit guidance. A continued crackdown on password sharing and Netflix's growing advertising business drove the positive results.

The decision to stop sharing subscription numbers ""invites worry about the outlook for subscriber growth in '25 and beyond,"" Pivotal Research analyst Jeffrey Wlodarczak said in a note on Thursday.

But he's not worried at all, and is instead enthusiastic about the results and likened Netflix's subscriber data decision to Apple's decision in 2018 to stop reporting iPhone unit growth.

Advertisement

""We remind investors that AAPL stop disclosing iPhone unit growth in 4Q 2018 and after a short period of stock consolidation the stock materially outperformed the market and we believe while '25+ subscriber growth will slow we still see a long runway for subscriber/ARPU growth going forward,"" Wlodarczak said.

Wlodarczak raised his Netflix price target to $800, representing potential upside of 41% from current level. That's also the highest price target on Wall Street for Netflix.

""Our view remains unchanged that Netflix has clearly won the streaming wars as evidenced by yet another strong across the board beat and raised guidance, especially relative to its streaming peers, and this is what, in our view, winning looks like,"" Wlodarczak said.

The key for Netflix going forward is to use its scale to ""keep the flywheel going,"" Wlodarczak said, that way the company can get more leverage over its competitors and content creators, as well as improve its product for consumers.

Article content In the past, subscriber numbers have been wildly unpredictable, and the company has struggled to forecast them accurately. In 2022, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said it would stop projecting quarterly customer data. The stock typically sees big swings the day after earnings reports. On Thursday, Netflix reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, including 9.33 million new subscribers. But the shares slumped after the company said user growth this quarter would slow and that it will stop reporting customer numbers. “Eliminating regular reporting of membership data raises questions around management’s confidence to further grow the base, though it is not implausible that the change is intended to reduce quarterly sentiment volatility around relatively small changes in true economic drivers,” Michael Morris, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Netflix isn’t the only big tech company to pull back on disclosing some metrics in order to steer investors’ focus elsewhere. In 2018, Apple said it would no longer report the number of iPhones, Macs and iPads sold each quarter, as it attempted to focus on its growing services unit. While some pundits praised the move as a way to highlight a potent new business model, others complained it was an attempt to hide the pain of a stagnant smartphone market. The shares had their worst day in four years.

The San Francisco-based company said it also won’t provide daily and monthly user numbers for its flagship Facebook app. Beginning this quarter, Meta will report year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level, while continuing to report only daily active users across its family of apps. “Fewer disclosures is a rite of passage for large tech companies namely Apple, Google, and Meta,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note. “On the other hand, removing growth disclosures signals a maturing business, and gives shareholders even fewer data points to underwrite forecasts. Time will tell how investors digest the change.” The good news for Netflix is that its decision, while angering some investors, is unlikely to have any impact on customers — its primary focus. In 2011, the company was forced to backtrack on plans to split its mail-order DVD and internet streaming services. Customers were outraged over plans to create a separate DVD offering called Qwikster, and to pay for each service separately. The company reversed the decision three weeks later.

Article content Netflix’s growth in the latest quarter was aided by a crackdown on account sharing, which pushes viewers using someone else’s password to sign up on their own at a discounted rate. The company attracted new customers from all over the world, thanks to a strong slate of original programs, showing particular strength in the US and Canada. Those new subscribers helped the company beat forecasts for sales and earnings as well. In explaining the decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers and average revenue per user, co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters said initiatives like the crackdown and a new ad-supported tier make those metrics less relevant. “All of that means that historical simple math that we all did, number of members times the monthly price is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business,” he said in a video interview Thursday.

Last year, Winfrey was criticized online alongside Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson when the stars appealed to the public to make donations after wildfires devastated areas of Maui in Hawaii. Billionaire Winfrey and millionaire Johnson were scrutinized by critics who called on the pair to fund aid to the island themselves.

The issue, Newsweek's chief royal correspondent Jack Royston told Royal Report listeners, was that the stars approached the fundraising with the wrong tone, with more progressive young people emerging as increasingly anti-rich and anti-privilege.

As Prince Harry embarks on a new Netflix show focused on the wealthy and elite sport of polo, Royston notes that any reference to the millions in charitable donations raised by the sport each year will need to be done with the right tone to avoid the reputational mistakes made by Winfrey and Johnson.

""I think they need to get the tone absolutely perfectly right,"" he said of the upcoming Netflix show which was announced by Archewell Productions on April 11.

""I don't think they can just, in 2024, celebrate how exceptionally amazing and god-like these mega-rich polo players are, riding around in the sunshine on horses.""

""It's great that they raise money for charity. That's brilliant. Equally, we're still going through a cost-of-living crisis. A lot of people are still struggling in all kinds of ways with all kinds of things, and it was less than a year ago that everyone piled in on Oprah and the Rock over Maui. So, it's probably fair to say doing charity work does not, in and of itself, get you off the hook in the modern world.""

A day after the show announcement was made, Harry highlighted the charitable aspect of polo by playing in the Royal Salute Polo Challenge at the Grand Champions Polo Club in Florida in aid of his Sentebale charity.

Co-founded in 2006 with close friend Prince Seeiso of Lesotho, Sentebale provides support for young people in the African nations of Lesotho and Botswana, including those affected by HIV and AIDS.

Harry is not the only royal to connect his passion for polo with a charitable output. Prince William plays in an annual polo game to raise money for the charities connected with the Royal Foundation he runs with Princess Kate.

Despite the high-profile fundraising activities of these games, it is hard to disconnect the high-society aspect of the sport, where celebrities and notable figures come together to socialize. To play, polo is also fairly inaccessible. The game requires a large financial output to own or rent polo ponies, equipment and field space.

All this considered, and with the Winfrey-privilege controversy in mind, Royston highlights that tone will be ""really important"" for any project exploring polo and its fundraising to strike a balance.

""I do think there's an age-old formula here that they could follow which will help a lot, and that's to basically send themselves up and send up this world as well,"" he said.

""Like, don't just worship the polo players and the polo circuit and the polo world. Make light of it as well. People love Harry when he's funny. That's when he's at his most charming, and it diffuses the kind of flamboyant wealth bomb much more effectively than purely the presence of charity fundraising alone.

""The charity cause is fantastic,"" Royston said. ""It's great that it's there. People love it when stars raise money for charity. But as Oprah and the Rock have proved, charity alone is not a shield against allegations of privilege anymore.""

Newsweek has approached representatives of Harry via email for comment.

Harry's show will, according to Archewell Productions, ""pull the curtain back on the grit and passion of the sport, capturing players and all it takes to compete at the highest level.""

The project is reportedly in the early stages of development, focusing on the U.S. Open Polo Championship in Wellington, Florida. The show's title and release date have not yet been announced.

"{'id': 'newsweek', 'name': 'Newsweek'}",Lydia Mee,F1 News: Netflix to Produce A Documentary On Red Bull's Christian Horner?,Speculation about Christian and Geri Horner starring in a Netflix documentary has been dispelled by Christian himself.,https://www.newsweek.com/sports/f1-news-netflix-produce-documentary-red-bulls-christian-horner-1892721,https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2381520/geri-christian-horner.jpg,2024-04-22 12:00:01+00:00,"Rumors have been flying around the Formula One paddock suggesting that Christian Horner and his wife Geri may star in their own Netflix documentary. Inspired by the Beckhams, the series would offer a glimpse into the private life of the Red Bull Racing team principal and the former Spice Girl.

According to sources as reported by The Mirror, the proposed docu-series would aim to peel back the curtain on their lives beyond the paddock and put to bed the ongoing controversy surrounding the Red Bull team chief. The source commented:

""The idea that has been pitched is a really personal documentary, capturing Geri and Christian at home. Following the recent speculation about their relationship, there would be a huge amount of interest in seeing them together away from the race track and how they interact with their friends and family.""

Furthermore, another comment from the source emphasized the transformative nature of candid home scenes, highlighting the impact on Victoria Beckham's public perception: ""The off-the-cuff scenes at home between David and Victoria have completely transformed how they are viewed by people, particularly Victoria, who had the chance to show off her funny side.""

Despite these rumors, Christian Horner provided a definitive response at a post-race interview following Max Verstappen's victory at the Chinese Grand Prix. He refuted the claims of any such documentary being in the works. Horner stated:

""There's a lot being written about different things, but there's absolutely no plan to do a family documentary. I think Netflix do enough. And you see enough behind the scenes on that. So, there's absolutely no plan to do. So where that report has come from, I have no idea.""

Discussions about the documentary reportedly involve a potential partnership with a production company to pitch the series to Netflix, indicating that behind-the-scenes talks might be more exploratory at this stage. The idea appears to draw significantly from Geri's admiration for the Beckhams' documentary, which presented the family in a more relatable light.

Christian and Geri Horner's relationship has been in the public eye for several years, however, it has been under increased scrutiny recently with the investigation into Christian. A female employee of Red Bull Racing lodged a complaint of misconduct against the team chief, which came to light earlier this year. The internal independent investigation exonerated Horner of the accusations, however, this is now going through an appeal process."
