The court, in a unanimous decision, said the appeal was “improvidently granted,” meaning the Supreme Court should not have reviewed the case. That decision dismissing the case, issued after the court heard oral arguments, leaves a 2023 Wisconsin appeals court ruling against Amazon in place.

That ruling found that drivers in the Amazon Flex program are a part of the state’s unemployment insurance system and entitled to jobless pay if they are laid off. The decision means an Amazon subsidiary, Amazon Logistics, will likely be hit with a tax bill of more than $200,000.

Justice Ann Walsh Bradley, in a concurring decision, said the reason the court dismissed the case was that further review “would not serve any meaningful purpose” or any “further development of the law.” Justice Rebecca Bradley, in a separate writing, faulted Bradley for trying to explain the court’s decision, saying it “will only sow additional confusion.”

The case was closely watched for what effect a ruling would have on workers in the “gig economy.”

Amazon spokesperson Steve Kelly said the retailer was “disappointed that the Wisconsin Supreme Court declined to weigh in and provide much needed guidance on these matters and are determining our next steps.”

Labor unions, along with the state Department of Workforce Development, pushed for the Wisconsin Supreme Court to recognize the Amazon Flex workers as employees.

Stephanie Bloomingdale, president of the Wisconsin AFL-CIO, hailed the court’s action, calling it a “win for working people.”

“Far too often, especially in the emerging gig economy, big and powerful companies like Amazon use the misclassification of employees as independent contractors to deny working people essential workplace rights like minimum wages, overtime pay, and unemployment insurance,” she said.

Courts across the country have been grappling with similar questions as states struggle with how to treat workers who are hired for a particular job, often at the push of a button through a smartphone app, to deliver food, groceries, packages or perform a variety of tasks.

“The gig economy is clogging up the court with all of this stuff, all the time,” said Samantha Prince, assistant professor of law at Penn State Dickinson College of Law and an expert on worker misclassification and the gig economy. “It’s just nuts. We really need this stuff to be resolved and stay resolved and stop with all the uncertainty for everybody.”

Prince said the Wisconsin case “will likely resonate through the other gig company court cases.”

“The more cases that find that gig company drivers are employees, the more companies are going to have to pay their rightful share,” she said.

Every state has its own laws determining whether workers are employees or independent contractors, Prince said. Those laws set the rules for what wages and overtime the workers must be paid and, in this case, whether they are subject to unemployment benefits that the employer must contribute toward.

Employees who got approved for the Amazon Flex program could download an app for their personal phones showing blocks when they could deliver packages for the company. Workers would scan packages at the Amazon warehouse in Milwaukee and use their personal vehicles to deliver them, using a route suggested by Amazon.

After one Amazon Flex worker was fired, he filed for unemployment insurance. The Department of Workforce Development conducted an audit of more than 1,000 Amazon Logistics drivers between 2016 and 2018 and concluded the vast majority of drivers were employees, not independent contractors, and therefore eligible for unemployment insurance payments. The state told Amazon in 2018 that it owed more than $205,000 in unemployment insurance premiums.

The Wisconsin Labor and Industry Review Commission upheld the state DWD determination that the drivers were employees. Amazon Logistics sued and a Waukesha County circuit court judge ruled the drivers were independent contractors. Last year, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals overturned that ruling, agreeing with the state that the drivers were employees. That set up the appeal to the Wisconsin Supreme Court.

Many other states have looked at the issue.

A Virginia appeals court ruled in 2023 that Amazon Flex drivers were employees, not independent contractors, and ordered Amazon to pay unemployment insurance taxes and penalties.

A California state appeals court last year said app-based ride-hailing and delivery companies like Uber and Lyft can continue to treat their California drivers as independent contractors, allowing them to bypass other state laws requiring worker protections and benefits.

The U.S. Department of Labor enacted a new rule March 11 that aims to prevent the misclassification of workers as “independent contractors,” a step that could bolster both legal protections and compensation for millions in the U.S. workforce. That rule applies to wages and overtime, but not unemployment compensation."
"{'id': 'business-insider', 'name': 'Business Insider'}",mberg@businessinsider.com (Madeline Berg),What yachting industry insiders have to say about Jeff Bezos' superyacht,"Amazon founder Jeff Bezos' superyacht Koru, which cost a reported $500 million to build, was a big topic of conversation at the Palm Beach boat show.",https://www.businessinsider.com/jeff-bezos-yacht-superyacht-koru-beautiful-amazing-insiders-say-2024-3,https://i.insider.com/66023de416bde8d4ead20fb0?width=1200&format=jpeg,2024-03-27 09:00:02+00:00,"Jeff Bezos' yacht, which reportedly cost $500 million to build, completed its first year at sea.

The superyacht, Koru, was a frequent topic of conversation at the Palm Beach boat show.

Here's what industry insiders think about the vessel.

It's been just about a year since Koru, Jeff Bezos' $500 million megayacht, set sail from the Oceanco shipyard in the Netherlands, capturing the attention of yachting insiders and land dwellers alike.

Even after her first season at sea, the 127-meter ship is still one of the most talked about vessels among those in the know — and not just for the busty figurehead on its prow, which many have wrongly speculated is based on Bezos's fiancée. Koru was a hot topic at the annual Palm Beach International Boat Show, where the yachts of other billionaires were on display for sale or charter.

The overwhelming response from those Business Insider spoke to was awe, with many praising her unique design, commenting on her immense size, or remarking that they'd been lucky enough to see her up close.

""It's absolutely beautiful,"" said Federico Rossi, the COO of luxury yachtbuilder Rossinavi.

Still, due to the small size of the industry — and the fact that privacy is paramount in the yachting community — even those who complimented Koru mostly did not want to go on record in order to protect professional relationships.

""That thing's amazing,"" one such superyacht expert told BI. ""It's very well done in terms of craftsmanship.""

Unlike many other megayachts, Koru, which media billionaire Barry Diller's Eos inspired, is designed as a sailing yacht. That bucks the current trend of more severe-looking explorer boats — though Koru's 75-meter support vessel Abeona is of a more typical style,

""I heard back in 2018 or something that somebody had ordered a classic sailing yacht,"" the superyacht expert also told BI. ""You order 125 meters, that's not really going to be classic. But it is. I think it's pretty cool.""

Like most other megayachts, Koru is powered by her engines, which are reportedly innovative in their use of a kinetic energy recovery system. Industry experts, therefore, pointed out that her sails are more for looks than anything else — but that still works in her favor, with many praising her overall aesthetic appeal.

Related stories

""It's stunning,"" added a captain who has worked on several megayachts. He said he'd seen Koru in St. Barts, a favorite spot of Bezos and his fiancée Lauren Sanchez, over the holidays.

""There are definitely uglier boats out there,"" one yacht architect said. ""It's not like it's shaped like his rocket,"" he jokily added, referring to the phallic design of Blue Origin's New Shephard.

The yacht, which was used frequently by Bezos and Lauren Sanchez last summer, is hard to miss given its unique style — and its sheer size. MEGA/GC Images

Some, though, think the yacht is a bit excessive — which is saying something in a world where bigger is better and $250 million is a normal amount to spend.

""That's over the top. That's an insanely ridiculous boat,"" a longtime broker who favors discretion said. It's a ""whole big show.""

And the expert who praised the yacht's craftsmanship balanced his admiring comments by saying Koru's liberal use of teak — a wood traditionally used for yacht decks — was ""bizarre.""

The material has gained a bad reputation in the industry in recent years, as it typically comes from Myanmar, a country with a checkered human rights record. Plus, it takes a long time to grow, leading to deforestation.

Many shipyards have now turned to alternatives, like bamboo or plantation-grown teak, in their pushes toward sustainability. Bezos' team did not respond to BI's question about the origin of the deck's wood.

Advertisement

Teak or not, the yachting industry isn't generally known for being all that environmentally friendly — or indeed lowkey, so many who BI talked to didn't buy into the idea that Koru is ""too much.""

""If this is genuinely Jeff's dream come true, then great,"" Anders Kurtén, the CEO of brokerage Fraser Yachts, said. ""I'm genuinely happy for him, and I'm happy for the people who got the opportunity to have employment to work on that.""

And Bezos, of course, isn't the only billionaire with a stunning yacht. Billionaires like Jerry Jones and Bernard Arnault have also, at times, turned heads with their boats.

Most recently, insiders have tied Mark Zuckerberg to a 118-meter ship named Launchpad. It's the latest superyacht to capture the yachting world's attention.

So, as she sets sail for her debut summer season, Launchpad may take Koru's place as the main yacht on everyone's radar this year."

Article content Japan has become a difficult market for companies that need green electricity to meet internal emissions targets and customer demands. The country currently relies on fossil fuels for more than 70% of its power generation, and while it committed along with the rest of the world at COP28 in Dubai in December to tripling global renewable capacity by 2030, the country plans to keep burning coal, oil and gas for much of its electricity. The government is making the utmost effort to make renewable energy the main source of power, the New and Renewable Energy Division within Japan’s Agency for Natural Resources and Energy said in a statement. A group of more than 400 global firms has been calling on Japan since 2021 to increase its investments in renewable energy, so that clean power could make up roughly half of the energy mix by 2030, from a target of around 38% by the end of this decade. That strategy is typically reviewed every three years or so and the government is expected to revisit it starting this year. In 2022, RE100 companies were able to meet 25% of their demand for electricity in Japan from renewable sources, lower than the global average of 50%.

Article content Japan’s energy policymakers say that the country’s mountainous terrain and relative isolation as an island nation make it more difficult and costly to develop renewable energy at scale. At the same time, the country’s power grid remains isolated, a legacy of Japan’s 10 major regional utility monopolies, making it difficult to get renewable power to where it can be used. Japan is leaning heavily on future technologies like carbon capture and storage, or co-firing of ammonia or hydrogen, to reduce the CO2 emissions generated by fossil fuels, but that doesn’t meet the needs of companies committed to renewable energy now. Amazon has announced more than 500 renewable energy projects globally, although Haig emphasized it’s difficult for the company to procure clean electricity across Asia. A power purchase agreement signed in 2022 with Indonesia’s state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara to buy clean electricity from a solar project is bigger than the cumulative amount of power Amazon has been able to procure in Japan, he said. “It’s very hard for us to purchase renewable power in this part of the world,” he said referring to Asia. “We’re trying to fix that. It’s not a technology problem, it’s a policy and market problem.”

Article content Japan has announced a plan to invest more than 150 trillion yen ($990 billion) in public and private money for so-called green transformation, which includes 31 trillion yen for renewables, the second-largest allocation after automotive. But climate analysts say the nation needs to do more. Spending allocations from the debt instrument are misaligned with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s guidance on limiting the rise in global temperatures, climate research group InfluenceMap said in November. Global companies with operations in Japan as well as domestic firms have renewable targets they are aiming to make by 2030 but insufficient supplies are jeopardizing those goals, said Kahori Miyake, co-chair of Japan Climate Leaders Partnership, which partners with the RE100. “We’re trying as much as possible as individual companies but the total amount of clean energy that is available in Japan is just not enough at the moment,” said Miyake.

The infusion brings Amazon’s total investment in Anthropic, a well-regarded builder of AI tools able to generate text and analysis, to $4 billion, following an earlier investment announced in September. As part of that deal, Amazon had the right to contribute the additional funds in the form of a convertible note, provided it did so before the end of March.

As part of the tie-up, Anthropic has also agreed to use Amazon Web Services data centers to power some of its operations, and to use Amazon’s custom-built computer chips. Anthropic, based in San Francisco, has also committed to using chips from Alphabet Inc.’s Google, another close partner.

Anthropic is tied up with multiple big tech companies, including Google, which joined a $450 million round of financing last May led by Spark Capital. Google and Amazon Web Services are both Anthropic’s cloud computing partners.

Anthropic was formed in 2021 by former employees of OpenAI, including Daniela Amodei and her brother Dario, who serves as its chief executive officer. The company has since become one of OpenAI’s most formidable competitors, raising billions in funding. Most of its customers are businesses, ranging from search engine DuckDuckGo to travel guide publisher Lonely Planet.

The company, which offers a chatbot named Claude, has emphasized developing AI safely and responsibly. In early March, it introduced new software for the chatbot that it said will be better at carrying out complicated instructions and less prone to making things up.

Chatbots capable of mimicking human conversation have become an increasing focus of Silicon Valley companies — with fast tech advances fueling an investing frenzy. Chatbots themselves are by no means new. But the technology powering Claude and competitors’ bots is a more powerful tool known as a large language model, which is trained on massive swaths of the internet in order to generate text, such as an answer to a question or a poem. Such tools are an application of generative AI, systems that consider input such as a text prompt and use it to output new content."

Article content “We’re expanding capacity quite significantly,” said Kevin Miller, an AWS vice president who oversees the company’s data centers. “I think that just gives us the ability to get closer to customers.” Over the past two years, according to a Bloomberg tally, Amazon has committed to spending $148 billion to build and operate data centers around the world. The company plans to expand existing server farm hubs in northern Virginia and Oregon as well as push into new precincts, including Mississippi, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. Amazon’s planned outlay on server farms dwarfs the public commitments from Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, though neither company discloses data center-related spending as consistently as Amazon. Microsoft and Google spokespeople declined to provide comparable figures and added that each company likely includes different costs in their estimates. Amid broader cost-cutting at Amazon, AWS’s capital expenditures on data centers shrank 2% in 2023—for the first time—even as Microsoft boosted its own spending by more than 50%, according to the research firm Dell’Oro Group. But Amazon’s chief financial officer said last month that capital expenditures would increase this year to support AWS growth, including AI-related projects.

Article content Much of Amazon’s data center expansion is geared toward meeting a rise in demand for corporate services like file storage and databases. But the facilities, along with advanced and expensive chips, will also provide the massive computing power required for an expected boom in generative artificial intelligence. Microsoft, close partner OpenAI and Google are widely seen as leaders in commercializing software capable of generating text and insights. But Amazon is building its own tools to rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT and has partnered with other companies to power AI services with its servers. As a result, Amazon expects to reap tens of billions of dollars in AI-related revenue. AWS put its first server farms in Virginia, on the fringes of metropolitan Washington. Home to the first commercial interchange for web traffic, the area remains a crucial hub for video streaming and corporate and government data. Amazon later opened data centers in rural eastern Oregon, taking advantage of cheap hydroelectric power and ample tax breaks. Virginia and Oregon have since received about four of every five dollars AWS spends on US infrastructure.

Article content Amazon plans to spend tens of billions more in those states, but it’s getting harder to secure electricity there. Data centers require lots of power, and their growing ubiquity is putting pressure on utilities. For a few months in 2022, Dominion Energy Inc., which powers Virginia’s data center alley, couldn’t keep up, pausing connections to facilities that were otherwise ready to come online. The utility expects demand to nearly double over the next 15 years, with the growth driven primarily by data centers. In Oregon, electricity use by Amazon server farms exceeds the local utility’s share of hydroelectric power, forcing it to buy electricity generated by natural gas, the Oregonian newspaper reported earlier this year. “There’s a lot more vetting that is occurring upfront and detailed planning that is required from the utility companies to understand how real the project is because there’s so much demand out there that was not there five years ago,” said Ali Greenwood, an executive director at the data center practice of Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate firm.

Article content So Amazon is getting creative. In February, the company said it would spend about $10 billion on two data center campuses in Mississippi. Billed as the largest corporate project in state history, AWS’s effort will plant roots in the southern US, a region that has seen comparatively little data center spending outside of major cities like Dallas and Atlanta. Earlier this month, the operator of a 40-year-old nuclear power plant on the Susquehanna River in Pennsylvania said AWS had agreed to spend $650 million to acquire a data center campus connected to the facility. In Round Rock, Texas, AWS recently won zoning approval to build a data center and electrical substation next to a delivery depot on a slice of a former ranch the company acquired during a pandemic-era spending spree. If the project proceeds, it will be the first time the company has put such facilities on the same piece of land. “Right now it’s just a mad scramble for any place that has power any time soon,” said Charles Fitzgerald, a former Microsoft manager and Seattle-based investor who tracks cloud company spending.

Article content Even as it ramps up, Amazon and other companies are encountering growing opposition to data centers. Much of the current animus is centered in Virginia, where residents complain about server farms’ incessant hum and preservationists lament the sprawling facilities’ encroachment on Civil War battlefield sites. But pockets of resistance are popping up in other parts of the US and could grow as more and more data centers come online—whether they are built by Amazon or not. Renewable energy advocates also say the rush to build new facilities has given new life to old plants powered by planet-warming fossil fuels, and even helped make the case to build new ones. In Mississippi, for example, Amazon will pay to help the local utility to build solar farms, but the company will also operate the data centers with a new natural-gas power plant that will probably operate for decades. “Companies like Amazon are going to have to use their buying power to actually force the utilities to change their behavior,” said Daniel Tait, research and communications manager with the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog that backs renewables. “Not only are they inducing more fossil fuel use, but they are creating the precedent that everybody who comes after them will do the same.”

Article content In recent years, Amazon has been the world’s largest corporate buyer of renewable energy, part of a pledge to power all of its operations with renewable electricity by 2025. But those projects can be far from its data centers, a mismatch between supply and demand that bedevils the fractured and aging US power grid. Amazon data center chief Miller said the company was continuing to evaluate clean energy projects beyond wind and solar farms, including battery storage and nuclear power, that can substitute for fossil fuel plants. He pledged to work with utilities and find a way to “match our need for energy with renewable, carbon-free power.”

Before tossing that almond milk labeled ""best before"" March 2024, try the smell test. There's a good chance it's safe to drink and blend into smoothies.

Nearly 60 types of date labels appear on food and drinks in US grocery stores, but few convey useful information about quality or safety. The mixed messages have confused Americans for decades and are estimated to be responsible for about 7% of the 78 million tons of food wasted across the country, ReFed, a national nonprofit, said .

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""Consumers ascribe more meaning to date labels than they should,"" Tori Oto, a clinical fellow at the Harvard Law School Food Law and Policy Clinic, told Business Insider. ""There is no federal regulation of date labels. It's a state-by-state patchwork, or it's up to the manufacturers' discretion of what phrasing to use.""

Clearing up the confusion could decrease food waste, save people money, and help tackle the climate crisis. Households are responsible for the majority of US food waste, and the US Department of Agriculture has estimated that the average family of four loses about $1,500 a year to uneaten food. Meanwhile, rotting food accounts for about 58% of the methane emissions from landfills, according to the EPA.

Oto said labels should be cut down to two options: ""best if used by"" to indicate the quality of the product and ""use by"" to signal when the product shouldn't be consumed. Oto also said there should be a consumer-education campaign to address the issue. In a survey of American adults conducted in April 2016 , more than one-third said they usually threw food away if it was close to or past a date on the package.

About three dozen members of Congress have sponsored legislation , known as the Food Date Labeling Act of 2023, that would require manufacturers to use only ""best if used by"" and ""use by."" The bill also has support from at least 20 retailers and brands, including Whole Foods, Amazon, Kroger, Walmart, and Nestlé — the companies signed a letter to lawmakers in February encouraging them to pass the bill.

Danielle Melgar, a food and agriculture advocate at PIRG, a public-interest watchdog group, said the endorsement from businesses marked a major shift from 2021 when the legislation was first introduced. Reducing food waste is a way for companies to make progress on their sustainability goals, Melgar added.

Melgar and other supporters of the bill were handing out the letter to congressional offices last week in hopes of building momentum in Washington. She said the main question from Republican lawmakers was whether the food industry supports the bill.

The industry has voluntarily tried to streamline food-date labeling: In 2019, Kroger said it would display only ""use by"" and ""best if used by"" to communicate food safety and quality on dairy, deli, bakery, and fresh and frozen items; Walmart made a similar move for its private label in 2016; and an industry trade association launched its own push in 2017 .

But Oto argued that given how many labels still proliferate, it's clear that a national standard is needed.

""Voluntary initiatives were a great first start in socializing this idea of consumer confusion over date labels,"" she said. ""But we still see 60 different phrases in any given grocery store. So buy-in has to be more comprehensive."""

The latest development is that Amazon will get to broadcast an NFL wildcard game in 2025. Amazon will continue broadcasting a wildcard game into the future after this first game, NFL executive vice president Hans Schroeder announced this week, via NBC Sports.

This will now be the second NFL playoff game exclusively available via streaming. The NFL tested out its first streaming-only playoff game earlier this year when the Kansas City Chiefs-Miami Dolphins playoff game aired only on Peacock.

This change has become unpopular for many fans, especially in a T.V. and sports media landscape that is increasingly requiring fans and viewers to pay for more and more subscription plans.

While one of these streaming services alone might not prove that costly, they do add up quickly. It appears that the days when games solely aired on FOX, NBC, ABC, ESPN and CBS are fading away.

As more and more families and viewers cord-cut and get rid of their cable subscriptions, the NFL is naturally looking into opportunities to expand the platforms their games air on and utilize popular streaming services. The NFL has already partnered with Amazon to air their Thursday Night Football games on the service during the season.

In their first NFL playoff game exclusively on streaming, Chiefs-Dolphins on Peacocks brought in strong ratings with 23 million viewers tuning in for the most streamed NFL game ever. However, streaming is still new for NFL games and naturally, more fans were going to tune in to a playoff game, especially with Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs playing.

In addition, this game brought in the fewest viewers of any playoff game during wildcard weekend. Cleveland Browns-Houston Texans (NBC/Peacock) and Tampa Bay Buccaneers-Philadelphia Eagles (ESPN) each attracted around 29 million viewers. The postponed Pittsburgh Steelers-Buffalo Bills game (CBS/Paramount Plus) drew in 31 million viewers. Los Angeles Rams-Detroit Lions (NBC/Peacock) grabbed 36 million viewers during a thrilling game. Green Bay Packers-Dallas Cowboys (FOX) won the weekend with 40 million viewers tuning into the game.

Even with the streaming games bringing in the fewest amount of viewers, the NFL was paid around a whopping $110 million to broadcast the Chiefs-Dolphins game on Peacock. With the NFL cashing in for the broadcast rights to just one game, it's unsurprising to see the league continue these streaming partnerships."

CNN —

Earth’s oceans are teeming with a multitude of life — and mysteries.

To better understand the ocean floor, enterprising marine scientists decided to affix tags equipped with cameras to tiger sharks that patrol the shallow tropical seas of the Bahamas.

Thanks to data collected by these apex predators, researchers revealed the world’s largest known seagrass ecosystem, which covers an area of about 35,000 square miles (92,000 square kilometers), according to a 2022 study.

Seagrasses can store massive amounts of carbon that could be a crucial tool to help mitigate the climate crisis, marine biologist and study coauthor Dr. Austin Gallagher recently told CNN. Gallagher is CEO of the research group Beneath the Waves.

And as scientists look back over Earth’s history, fossils are painting a portrait of other aquatic ecosystems from the past.

When researchers spied unusual rock fragments jutting from the ground near the Napo River in Peru’s Loreto region, they pieced them together and realized they were looking at something unexpected.

“We started screaming: ‘It’s a dolphin! It’s a dolphin!’” said Aldo Benites-Palomino, a doctoral candidate of paleontology at the University of Zurich in Switzerland.

The newly identified dolphin species lived in a freshwater lake in the Peruvian Amazon 16 million years ago. And the creature measured about 11 feet (3.2 meters) long, making it twice the size of some humans.

The find is helping to fill the gaps in the evolutionary history of freshwater dolphins, which are incredibly rare in the fossil record.

A long time ago

Genetic material recovered from the tomb of a sixth century Chinese emperor has enabled scientists to create a 3D reconstruction of the monarch’s face.

Emperor Wu ruled China from 560 to 580 and unified the northern part of China during a chaotic period when dynasties quickly rose and fell.

While a cause of death couldn’t be determined for Wu, who died suddenly at age 36, ancient DNA analysis uncovered that he had a genetic susceptibility to stroke.

Most intriguing to researchers was that Wu belonged to a little-studied nomadic group called the Xianbei, which lived across modern Mongolia and northeastern China.

On April 8, astrophotographer Stan Honda will be stationed in Fredericksburg, Texas, armed with four cameras to document the total solar eclipse.

And Honda has tips for those who want to photograph the historic celestial event, whether you’re using a DSLR camera or a smartphone. Grab a safe solar filter for your camera and never look at the sun through an unfiltered camera, even when wearing eclipse glasses.

Honda recommends using manual focus to capture different eclipse phases, such as the “diamond ring” effect, as the moon slowly blocks the sun’s light.

Experts have also warned about counterfeit eclipse glasses entering the market. Here’s how to test your glasses to make sure they are safe, and everything you need to know about eye safety before the eclipse.

And now, it’s time to count down to April 8! Mark your Apple iCal or Outlook, Google, or Office365 calendar with the date of the upcoming total solar eclipse, which CNN will be covering live.

We are family

A marble tomb in Mount Vernon, Virginia, is the final resting place of George Washington, the first US president. But questions have remained about the fate of some of his family members, such as Washington’s younger brother Samuel, who died in 1781.

He and 19 other members of the Washington family were buried in the cemetery at Samuel’s Harewood estate near Charles Town, West Virginia. Some of the graves, including Samuel’s, were unmarked, likely to deter grave robbers.

Now, researchers have taken remains excavated from Harewood in 1999 and used new DNA analysis techniques to identify two of Samuel’s grandsons and their mother.

While the location of Samuel’s grave remains a mystery, the latest techniques could help identify unknown remains of those who served in the military.

Meanwhile, new excavations of Pompeii have revealed the site of a home renovation that was likely occurring when Mount Vesuvius erupted in AD 79.

Within the residence, archaeologists found piles of building materials near a reception area decorated with a mythological painting.

The site provides a close look at the Roman construction techniques used thousands of years ago, including sustainable materials and a stronger recipe for concrete, that could be applied today.

Separately, researchers uncovered the remains of what site director Francesca Giarelli of Red River Archaeology Group called a “remarkable” Roman villa complex, including a collection of tiny, tightly coiled lead scrolls, in a village in the English county of Oxfordshire.

“Due to the unprecedented demand for these medicines, some patients may experience difficulty when trying to fill their prescription at their pharmacy,” a Lilly spokesperson said.

The US Food and Drug Administration doesn’t currently consider the obesity shot in shortage and Lilly said it “continues to manufacture and ship all doses of Zepbound.”

Rite Aid Corp. and Amazon Pharmacy said that the drug was in short supply, and multiple pharmacists across the US told Bloomberg News that some or all of the doses of the drug were on backorder.

On the website of Amazon Pharmacy, which has a partnership with Lilly, four doses of Zepbound are listed as unavailable. An Amazon spokesperson confirmed there is a “nationwide shortage” of some weight-loss medications, including Zepbound.

A Rite Aid spokesperson told Bloomberg News the demand for the obesity shot has “created some sporadic supply constraints.”

Other large pharmacy chains, including CVS Health Corp., Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., and Walmart Inc. did not respond to requests for comment on their Zepbound supply.

Pharmacists say they’re having difficulty ordering the drugs from major wholesalers. On Mar. 25, wholesaler McKesson Corp.’s ordering system displayed to one pharmacist that all doses of Zepbound were on a supplier backorder, with the next release of drugs expected in early or mid-April, according to records reviewed by Bloomberg News. Full recovery of supply was “TBD,” the notice said.

Cardinal Health Inc., another distributor, was also reporting a manufacturer backorder for some doses of Zepbound and limiting shipments to pharmacies, said Richard Glotzer, owner and pharmacist at Drug Mart of Millwood in Westchester County. A CVS pharmacy technician in Ohio, who asked not to be identified, provided the same information.

McKesson and Cardinal did not respond to requests for comment.

Article content The Australian market was strategically selected due to its location in the Asia-Pacific region as a kickoff for a planned expansion of the Company’s entire product line across the region. According to Research and Markets, the Asia Pacific (APAC) baby, infant and toddler food market is expected to grow from an estimated market size of US$50 billion in 2021 to over US$75 billion in 2028. Both products are now available on Amazon in Australia, and plans are in place to roll them out through other online retailers and brick-and-mortar retail locations. These products that use innovative plant-based ingredients were produced by Else’s partner production site in Europe, adhering to stringent quality standards. Else’s plant-based formula, which received the Clean Label Project Purity Award, addresses an unmet need in the infant formula market, which according to Fortune Business Insights, is projected to grow from $71.83 billion in 2023 to $141.70 billion by 2030. Else’s infant formula meets strict regulatory and nutritional standards based on human-milk nutritional gold standards, which all infant formula must meet, including ratio standards for amino acids, fatty acids, and macronutrients, setting a new bar for quality in the infant nutrition sector. Else’s plant-based infant formula also addresses consumer concerns about processed ingredients, major allergens, and potential residues found in standard dairy-based formulas.

Article content In contrast, current core ingredients in standard infant formulas are ultra-processed, often leading to undesired symptoms. Current dairy formulas, which represent approximately 95% of the market, have shown certain side effects in many infants and their main ingredients are major allergens, with additional concerns related to antibiotics, hormones and other undesired materials, as well as animal welfare and environmental considerations. Moreover, these dairy formula ingredients cannot stay in their whole form due to the need to use fractionated ingredients in order to meet the desired nutritional composition, and they must use highly processed derivatives. Furthermore, soy protein formulas, which account for about 5% of the market, frequently generate similar side effects and contain high levels of phytoestrogens as well as GMOs. Similar to dairy formulas, soy protein formulas cannot stay in their whole form as they require fractionated ingredients in order to meet the required nutritional values. The protein must be isolated and chemically processed with solvents, and the fats and carbohydrates are also considered ultra-processed foods.

Article content Else’s infant formula is free of antibiotics, hormones, pesticides, GMOs, and heavy metals – all of which are an increasing concern among parents. The core ingredients, almonds, buckwheat, and tapioca, have a ~65% lower carbon footprint and require zero chemical processing, keeping proteins intact. The Company’s infant formula is meticulously crafted to support infants aged 6-12 months as they transition to solid foods, ensuring they receive essential nutrients for optimal growth and development. Hamutal Yitzhak, CEO and Co-Founder of Else Nutrition, stated, “We are extremely proud to officially launch our infant formula and our toddler drink in Australia, serving as a beachhead for the planned global expansion of our range of breakthrough products. This first-in-class infant product is designed to provide infants with a more nutritious, healthier, and safer alternative.” “We selected Australia after a meticulous evaluation of the regulatory framework and were deemed in compliance. Australia is widely recognized for its rigorous health and other regulatory standards. In addition, Australia is strategically located in the Asia Pacific region, which we envision will be an ideal market from which to expand our other line of products across the region. The Asia Pacific region represents an extremely large addressable market, desiring safe and high-quality Western products, especially in the children’s health and nutrition categories. Our strategic focus is on establishing partnerships in this region to support our expansion efforts.”

Amazon will pull the system as it remodels existing Fresh grocery stores and won’t feature it in new locations that will start opening later this year, an Amazon spokesperson said.

Tony Hoggett, Amazon’s senior vice president of grocery stores, joined the company in 2022 and launched a far-reaching revamp of the grocery business, which has struggled to build market share in an industry dominated by the likes of Walmart Inc. and Kroger Co.

Amazon plans to rely more heavily on its Dash Cart, which lets shoppers scan items as they go. But the company has dialed back the complexity of the technology.

The carts initially used a set of cameras to automatically identify what shoppers had grabbed from the shelf. Newer versions stripped out some cameras, and shoppers are now asked to hold the item in front of a pair of scanners, which can read bar codes among other cues. Shoppers can also use a touchscreen to ring up merchandise, such as produce, that lacks bar codes.

The Information reported the scrapping of Just Walk Out technology earlier.

The system uses ceiling-mounted cameras and shelf sensors, backed by algorithms, to determine what a shopper took from a store. Customers are charged automatically upon exiting.

The company began developing the technology more than a decade ago, part of a push by Jeff Bezos, then chief executive officer, to develop a unique offering to accompany Amazon’s move into physical stores.

The technology debuted in 2018 with the opening of a convenience store in the lobby of Amazon’s Seattle headquarters. The company built dozens of Amazon Go branded convenience stores and later installed the cashierless system in Fresh Stores and a pair of Whole Foods Market locations.

The technology alienated some shoppers, who were put off by entry gates or the feeling that Amazon had turned a visit to the grocery store into a high-tech vending machine. Receipts, which arrived digitally a few minutes to hours after a shopper checked out, also weren’t practical for big shops.

Amazon Go stores will still use Just Walk Out technology, and the company will continue to license it to other retailers. Smaller stores in the UK also will keep using the system."
"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",Eleanor Pringle,Taylor Swift and OpenAI’s Sam Altman join the ranks of freshly minted billionaires,"LVMH founder Bernard Arnault, Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg make up the richest people in the world.",https://fortune.com/2024/04/03/taylor-swift-sam-altman-net-worth-billionaires/,"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Copy-of-FeatTemplate-43.jpg?resize=1200,600",2024-04-03 10:16:17+00:00,"More than 260 new names have made it onto the list of the world’s billionaires, Forbes has revealed, with both Taylor Swift and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman making an appearance for the first time.

The new rankings also confirmed Tesla CEO Elon Musk once again lags behind luxury goods titan Bernard Arnault in the race to be the richest person on earth.

The 75-year-old French kingpin Arnault, who oversees fashion empire LVMH with a net worth of $233 billion, led the record-breaking pack of 2,781 billionaires—more than ever before.

Moreover, the report found that 14 people are now centibillionaires with 12-figure fortunes.

Who are the world’s richest people?

Behind Arnault and X owner Musk—who has a fortune of $195 billion—are Amazon founder Jeff Bezos ($194 billion), Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg ($177 billion), and Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison ($141 billion).

Further down the top 10 are Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett ($133 billion), Microsoft duo Bill Gates ($128 billion) and Steve Ballmer ($121 billion), Asia’s richest person Mukesh Ambani ($116 billion), and Google founder Larry Page ($114 billion).

And while the forerunners are made up of well-known faces, a host of new individuals also made it onto the list.

Swift’s Eras Tour propelled her to a net worth of $1.1 billion, while OpenAI’s CEO Altman also appeared courtesy of $1 billion in wealth.

Altman’s wealth isn’t made up of a stake in the company he runs—he has repeatedly said that he does not own equity in the company.

Rather, much of his traceable wealth is in a web of VC funds and startup investments, which is set to grow with the initial public offering of Reddit, where he’s among the largest shareholders.

The list’s youngest name—and appearing for the first time—is 19-year-old heiress Livia Voigt, who has inherited a $1.1 billion fortune courtesy of stakes in Brazilian wind manufacturer WEG, which was founded by her grandfather.

And despite a reported slowdown in luxury goods sales, fashion designer Christian Louboutin made it into the rankings with a net wealth of $1.2 billion.

America prevailed as home to the world's richest people, boasting a record 813 individuals with a combined wealth of $5.7 trillion.

Coming second: China and Hong Kong, with 473 individuals worth $1.7 trillion.

India ranks third with $954 billion across 200 individuals on the list.

“It’s been an amazing year for the world’s richest people, with more billionaires around the world than ever before,” said Chase Peterson-Withorn, Forbes senior editor, wealth. “Even during times of financial uncertainty for many, the super-rich continue to thrive.”

It's worth noting that Forbes's annual list does differ in its rankings from the likes of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which also places Arnault in the number one spot followed by Bezos.

Musk comes in third, followed by Zuckerberg, Gates, and Ballmer—though the net wealth of the majority differs between the two rankings.

How did Taylor Swift make her billion?

Swift, now a 14-time Grammy award winner, has had a stratospheric 12 months courtesy of her global tour which was the first ever to gross more than $1 billion.

Demand for tickets was so high that Ticketmaster experienced a raft of glitches and technical problems, with the fiasco ending in the cancellation of a public sale for the spots.

Fans traveled from far and wide to see the 34-year-old songstress in action, with research firm QuestionPro finding Swift will add a total of $4.6 billion to the U.S. economy courtesy of consumers spending on meals out, merch, and overnight stays.

As well as live shows, Swift also has a massive catalog of music, estimated by Bloomberg to be worth $400 million since 2019 alone.

This includes the re-releases of albums such as Fearless and 1989, which Swift re-recorded after her masters were sold to music mogul and manager, Scooter Braun.

According to Bloomberg, Swift's earnings from Spotify and YouTube total around $120 million while royalties from music sales rake in another $80 million.

The Pennsylvania-born songwriter and actress also owns property worth a reported $110 million per Bloomberg, with the New York Post listing her assets across a Tribeca townhouse with an attached apartment for security, an eight-bed mansion in Rhode Island, and a penthouse in Nashville.

The streaming giant will increase prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets by the end of April, including the UK, Australia and Pakistan, according to people familiar with the matter. It will raise prices in the US, its largest territory, later this year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential plans.

Spotify shares jumped 4.6% to $281.92 at 9:35 a.m. in New York.

The higher prices will help cover the cost of audiobooks, a popular service introduced late last year. Spotify offers customers up to 15 hours of audiobook listening a month as part of their paid plan. While the company pays publishers for books, it has so far only collected additional revenue from listeners who exceed the limit.

The Swedish audio company is also going to introduce a new basic tier that will offer music and podcasts — but not audiobooks — for the current $11 monthly price of an individual premium plan, said the people. Users of that plan will need to pay for audiobooks.

The new basic tier is the first of what will be several new pricing options from Spotify. The company has also been working on a “supremium” plan, which would charge customers a higher price for access to high-fidelity audio, among other features, as Bloomberg reported last year.

For years, Spotify offered most customers two options — a free, advertising-supported music service with limited functionality and a paid listening product with unlimited access.

But the company has lost money every year since it went public in 2018, largely because it pays out about 70% of its sales in royalties to the music industry. Spotify paid record labels, artists and others more than $9 billion last year – from $13.2 billion in revenue.

Management has attempted to reduce Spotify’s reliance on the music industry by offering other types of entertainment.

The company dabbled in video before deciding to focus on offering many different kinds of audio. It began by pouring billions of dollars into podcasts, an emerging field of on-demand audio. While management has said podcasts will turn a profit this year, Spotify also fired thousands of employees and curtailed its investment in original audio programming.

Last year, the company announced big plans in audiobooks, a field dominated by Amazon.com Inc.’s Audible. While Audible customers must pay to listen to almost any book, Spotify offered its customers free, limited access. The results so far have been strong, at least in terms of consumption.

Spotify’s move into other kinds of programming has alarmed its partners in the music industry, who fret the company will try to reduce their royalties. As a result, major music companies have been pushing Spotify and its competitors to raise prices.

While Netflix Inc. has doubled the price of its most popular plan in recent years, Spotify only raised prices in major markets last year for the first time since introducing its premium audio service to the US in 2011. Despite concerns that some subscribers would cancel, the company posted its best year of user growth ever, with 113 million new sign-ups to its free and paid services.

Spotify had 602 million users at the end of 2023, including 236 million paying customers.

The success of the price increase has given management confidence to seek even more. Under the new pricing, individual plans will go up by about $1 a month, while family plans and so-called duo plans for couples will rise by $2.

Spotify’s biggest competitors, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., have also raised prices for their music services.

Music companies and audio services are also discussing ways to generate additional money from the most ardent fans. Currently, all listeners pay the same rate for access to a musician’s catalog. But there are fans willing to pay far more to support an artist they love, as evidenced by the rising price of concert tickets, merchandise and even vinyl for Korean artists.

Among the various options, streaming services have discussed charging people more for early access to new music. Yet the companies are reluctant to significantly alter the main paid product – such as Spotify’s $11-a-month, all-you-can-listen plan. Whether or not management figures out how to capitalize on the more-loyal fans, the cost of that main service is only going up."

Amazon's Just Walk Out technology had a secret ingredient: Roughly 1,000 workers in India who review what you pick up, set down, and walk out of its stores with.

The company touted the technology, which allowed customers to bypass traditional checkouts, as an achievement powered entirely by computer vision. But Just Walk Out was still very reliant on humans, The Information reported on Tuesday, citing an unnamed person who has worked on Just Walk Out technology.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

About 700 of every 1,000 Just Walk Out sales had to be reviewed by Amazon's team in India in 2022, according to The Information. Internally, Amazon wanted just 50 out of every 1,000 sales to get a manual check, according to the report.

An Amazon spokesperson disputed that claim in a statement to Business Insider, saying that the team in India mostly helps train the model that the company used for Just Walk Out.

""Associates may also validate a small minority of shopping visits where our computer vision technology cannot determine with complete confidence an individual's purchases,"" the spokesperson said.

The revelation comes as Amazon is planning to replace Just Walk Out at Amazon Fresh stores with its Dash Carts, The Information reported. The smart shopping carts also allow customers to avoid waiting in a checkout line, though they have to place their purchases in the cart, which keeps track of their selections and debits their accounts.

While customers used Just Walk Out at Amazon Fresh stores, ""they also wanted the ability to easily find nearby products and deals, view their receipt as they shop, and know how much money they saved while shopping throughout the store"" — all options that the company's Dash Cart provides, the company spokesperson said of the change.

Just Walk Out first appeared in Amazon Go convenience stores. The technology allowed customers to enter a store by identifying themselves with their Amazon account. From there, they could pick up items, put them back on the shelves, and walk out with their final picks, all without having to interact with a cashier.

In the last few years, Amazon has rolled Just Walk Out to larger-format stores. Twenty-seven of the 44 Amazon Fresh stores currently have the tech. Amazon also added Just Walk Out to some Whole Foods stores.

Startups have also created their own versions of Just Walk Out and tested them at retailers including Aldi and Dollar General.

When Amazon debuted cashier-less technology, it was hailed as the future of retail. But now, Amazon is walking back its “Just Walk Out” technology at its grocery stores, reining in grand promises of an automated, friction-less checkout.

Amazon said it is removing the technology at US Amazon Fresh grocery stores which allows customers to pay for their groceries without waiting in line for a cashier or using a self-checkout machine. Instead, Amazon said it’s replacing it with Dash Cart at its more than 40 locations, a “smart shopping cart” which allows shoppers to scan groceries, link to online shopping lists and check out their groceries. The company has been testing Dash Carts at some Fresh and Whole Foods locations in the past.

Customers just haven’t bought into cashier-less technology, especially in grocery stores where they purchase larger quantities and face extra tasks such as weighing produce. Amazon says the checkout technology may be more seamless in smaller stores – that could include the Amazon Go convenience stores.

In a statement, Amazon said it will continue using the Just Walk Out technology in Amazon Go stores, at smaller format Fresh stores in the UK, and third-party locations such as certain sports stadiums and college campuses. Amazon had used roughly 1,000 humans in India, according to some news reports, to help monitor accurate checkouts. The company told CNN it’s “reducing the number of human reviews” while developing the “Just Walk Out” technology. Amazon said besides data associates’ main role in working on the underlying technology, they also “validate a small minority” of shopping visits.

Customers entered Fresh stores using Amazon One palm recognition, the app or a credit or debit card. Amazon said “sensors, cameras, and deep learning tools” caught what customers took off the shelf, automatically charging them.

Amazon says it is also installing self-checkout kiosks and assisted checkout options at Fresh locations once they’ve transitioned to using Dash Cart.

Retailers from Dollar General to Walmart and Costco are rethinking the reliance on self-checkout, as they find it leads to higher merchandise losses from customer mistakes and shoplifting.

Amazon Fresh struggles

The tech giant opened its first Amazon Fresh store in 2020, and has more than 40 locations across the US. After Amazon bought Whole Foods in 2017, it added cashier-less checkout in those stores as well.

In 2021, Amazon eliminated checkout lines in a full-sized, 25,000-square-foot Amazon fresh store in Washington state, and announced it was ramping up openings of the stores. But Amazon Fresh has faced setbacks since it debuted, including challenges getting shoppers to buy groceries in its Amazon Fresh grocery stores, and it laid off workers.

Starting in 2023, the company said it was pausing Amazon Fresh store expansions.

“We’re doing a fair bit of experimentation today in those stores to try to find a format that we think resonates with customers,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in February 2023. “We’ve decided over the last year or so that we’re not going to expand the physical Fresh [stores] until we have that equation.”

In response, Amazon has redesigned Fresh stores in Chicago and Southern California. For example, in two Chicago-area locations in 2023, Amazon added hundreds of new name brands, more quick meal options, self-checkout kiosks and the Dash carts.

Agility Robotics reduced the size of its workforce on Wednesday.

The company told Business Insider that the job cuts affected a ""small number"" of employees.

""As part of Agility's ongoing efforts to structure the company for success, we have parted ways with a small number of employees that were not central to core product development and commercialization,"" a spokesperson said.

Amazon is testing its Agility's Digit robots in a research and development facility near Seattle. The tech giant has previously funded Agility as part of its first round of investments through its $1 billion Amazon Industrial Innovation Fund.

An electrical engineer at the humanoid robotics firm shared in posts on LinkedIn and X that he was ""one of the many laid off"" at the company.

He added that he was ""surprised at the timing"" because he'd only just been moved from the support engineering team to the electrical engineering team last year.

Related stories

Chief people officer Lisa Haugh commented on the LinkedIn post, saying she was ""sorry"" that he was ""a part of the small group impacted"" by the layoffs. It's not clear exactly how many employees Agility has or how many jobs were cut.

The job cuts underline the difficulty some robotics firms have with funding their activities even with the backing of tech giants, as Crunchbase has reported.

Agility also told BI that along with cutting jobs, it's also focused on meeting the ""extraordinary demand for bipedal robots across industrial use cases.""

""That means ramping up production of Digit while continuing to win top-tier global customers, and adding new roles that meet these goals. We believe today's actions will allow us to focus on the areas that drive productization, commercialization, and production of Digit.""

The two-legged Digit can lift and move items in warehouses and distribution centers.

The company announced last month that it appointed a new CEO, Peggy Johnson, as it prepares to open a factory in Oregon later this year to start mass-producing robots.

Johnson previously told BI that it will churn out ""hundreds"" of its Digit robots in 2025 and then ""ramp up capacity to thousands"" in the years that follow.

It's been touted by the firm as a way to potentially help ease the labor shortage in the manufacturing industry, as data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics projected there will be about one million openings for laborers and material movers over the next decade."

The clip was shared by Jennifer Greenberg (@the_green_bird_brigade), 42, who is based in Austin, Texas. The video, which was captured in Greenberg's home, has had views over 674,000 views since it was first posted on March 29. ""I rescue and rehabilitate parrots, as well as use my social media platforms to educate others on better care for their birds,"" she told Newsweek.

The latest bird she's been caring for is Poncho, a 39-year-old yellow-naped Amazon parrot. Born in New York in 1985 and purchased from a bird store by his original owner, Poncho spent ""the majority of the first 32 years of his life in a tiny cage,"" according to a caption shared with the video, which shows Poncho trying various things for the first time, from new foods to stepped onto Greenberg's arm.

His first owner had a large dog that ""went after Poncho,"" so the parrot was ""left in a room alone where the dog couldn't get him for years,"" the caption noted.

Poncho has been with Greenberg for two weeks and ""the biggest change I have seen in him is his willingness to trust me. He has never really trusted people before due to his background and being alone so long.""

Native to parts of Mexico as well as Central and South America, Amazon parrots were once a common species but deforestation and the pet trade have greatly reduced the numbers, according to the Parrot Outreach Society, a Florida-based nonprofit.

The nonprofit says: ""Most free-ranging species are considered threatened or endangered and efforts to protect these birds have resulted in a ban on importation for pet purposes in the United States. High quality companion birds are available from breeders.""

Amazon parrots are known for their ""excellent ability to mimic"" and the yellow-naped ones are among those that appear to have the best potential for talking, laughing, coughing or even imitating a baby's cry, according to the nonprofit.

As entertaining and engaging as they may seem, Amazon parrots don't always enjoy being touched or ""cuddled,"" the nonprofit warns.

""Some may be considered hyperactive or short-tempered"" and they're generally ""not good pets around children,"" the nonprofit added.

'He Is Quickly Learning'

Poncho was given to a friend of his first owner seven years ago, when the former owner ""could no longer care for him due to old age,"" according to a caption shared with the post.

""Unfortunately, Poncho's new family didn't know much about parrots, especially parrots like Poncho, who have trauma from their previous life. I hope to completely rehabilitate Poncho and help him find a life with someone who will give him everything he needs and deserves,"" the caption adds.

A message overlaid on the viral clip says: ""Things my 39 year old Amazon parrot did for the first time this week.""

The video goes on to show Poncho experiencing new food, such as vegetables out of a bowl. A note across the clip says ""Poncho has been on a junk food diet his whole life...so I started teaching to eat healthy foods from day 1.""

Poncho also learned to step onto Greenberg's arm as she lowers it to him, as seen in the video. ""Poncho has spent most of his life alone, so he isn't very trusting of people,"" however, ""he is quickly learning that I can help him get to where he wants to go,"" a message across the video reads.

The parrot is also shown sitting in a bigger enclosure. ""This is a hard reset for him. He is not sure about the toys, the perches, any of it,"" a voice in the clip says.

As the footage shows a white cage, a note across the screen says: ""Poncho has only known this small cage and the space around it for years.""

The bird is later shown taking a ""bath"" by getting himself wet in a bowl in an enclosure. ""He really didn't bathe in his last home and his feathers were very oily,"" a note across the screen reads.

The parrot later receives ""scritches"" from a hand that's shown massaging the top of the bird's head. He ""even asked for more,"" a message on the clip notes, as the bird is shown moving closer to the hand.

Poncho also managed to leave the safety of his cage, making his first step out of the cage and heading downstairs for the first time. The footage shows Poncho on a perch in a living room setting.

""His world just got a whole lot bigger,"" a message across the screen says as the video ends.

Article content “This suggests not only rising share buybacks, but a more aggressive capital return policy that could include a dividend,” he said. “If returns don’t increase, cash balances could soar above US$100 billion later this year.” Amazon had more than US$86 billion in cash at the end of 2023. For most of its three decades in existence, Amazon has opted to plow its cash back into the business. The last buyback was in 2022 for US$10 billion, which is a pittance compared with similar-sized peers.

Article content In 2023, Alphabet Inc. repurchased more than US$60 billion in shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Facebook-parent Meta Platforms Inc. spent more than US$20 billion on buybacks in the same period and in February pledged an additional US$50 billion while initiating its first-ever quarterly dividend. Amazon, by contrast, didn’t buy back any shares in 2023. A change in its capital-return policy would signal a shift as the company evolves under chief executive Andy Jassy, who took the reins from co-founder Jeff Bezos in 2021. Amazon shares have managed to outperform even in the absence of big buybacks. The stock has climbed 20 per cent this year, pushing its market value to US$1.9 trillion as analysts continue to hike profit estimates and traders grow increasingly optimistic about artificial intelligence helping to reinvigorate growth at Amazon Web Services.

Article content The Nasdaq 100 has gained eight per cent over the same period. Still, while Amazon is on the cusp of setting a new all-time high, it’s alone among the five biggest U.S. tech companies that isn’t yet in record territory. Microsoft Corp., for example, is trading about 20 per cent above its 2021 record, while Meta is up more than 30 per cent from its previous peak in the same year. Naveen Jayasundaram, a senior research analyst at ClearBridge Investments LLC, expects Amazon to announce a buyback in the tens of billions of dollars sometime this year, but sees a dividend as unlikely. “I think Amazon views itself as being earlier in the growth cycle compared with Alphabet and Meta, so I would be surprised if we got a dividend this year,” he said. “However, it does seem like something that could come in the next four to five years.” Amazon is expected to report first-quarter earnings later this month. Even though the company is still cutting costs, it has plenty to spend on. Amazon plans to pour almost US$150 billion in the coming 15 years on data centres to handle an anticipated explosion in demand for digital services related to artificial intelligence.

"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}","Matt O'Brien, The Associated Press",What is AGI and how will we know when it’s been attained?,"Achieving AGI is the driving mission of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and a priority for the elite research wings of tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft.",https://fortune.com/2024/04/05/what-is-agi-artificial-general-intelligence/,"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1505949625-e1712307281732.jpg?resize=1200,600",2024-04-05 08:55:45+00:00,"There’s a race underway to build artificial general intelligence, a futuristic vision of machines that are as broadly smart as humans or at least can do many things as well as people can.

Achieving such a concept — commonly referred to as AGI — is the driving mission of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and a priority for the elite research wings of tech giants Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft.

It’s also a cause for concern for world governments. Leading AI scientists published research Thursday in the journal Science warning that unchecked AI agents with “long-term planning” skills could pose an existential risk to humanity.

But what exactly is AGI and how will we know when it’s been attained? Once on the fringe of computer science, it’s now a buzzword that’s being constantly redefined by those trying to make it happen.

What is AGI?

Not to be confused with the similar-sounding generative AI — which describes the AI systems behind the crop of tools that “generate” new documents, images and sounds — artificial general intelligence is a more nebulous idea.

It’s not a technical term but “a serious, though ill-defined, concept,” said Geoffrey Hinton, a pioneering AI scientist who’s been dubbed a “Godfather of AI.”

“I don’t think there is agreement on what the term means,” Hinton said by email this week. “I use it to mean AI that is at least as good as humans at nearly all of the cognitive things that humans do.”

Hinton prefers a different term — superintelligence — “for AGIs that are better than humans.”

A small group of early proponents of the term AGI were looking to evoke how mid-20th century computer scientists envisioned an intelligent machine. That was before AI research branched into subfields that advanced specialized and commercially viable versions of the technology — from face recognition to speech-recognizing voice assistants like Siri and Alexa.

Mainstream AI research “turned away from the original vision of artificial intelligence, which at the beginning was pretty ambitious,” said Pei Wang, a professor who teaches an AGI course at Temple University and helped organize the first AGI conference in 2008.

Putting the ‘G’ in AGI was a signal to those who “still want to do the big thing. We don’t want to build tools. We want to build a thinking machine,” Wang said.

Are we at AGI yet?

Without a clear definition, it’s hard to know when a company or group of researchers will have achieved artificial general intelligence — or if they already have.

“Twenty years ago, I think people would have happily agreed that systems with the ability of GPT-4 or (Google’s) Gemini had achieved general intelligence comparable to that of humans,” Hinton said. “Being able to answer more or less any question in a sensible way would have passed the test. But now that AI can do that, people want to change the test.”

Improvements in “autoregressive” AI techniques that predict the most plausible next word in a sequence, combined with massive computing power to train those systems on troves of data, have led to impressive chatbots, but they’re still not quite the AGI that many people had in mind. Getting to AGI requires technology that can perform just as well as humans in a wide variety of tasks, including reasoning, planning and the ability to learn from experiences.

Some researchers would like to find consensus on how to measure it. It’s one of the topics of an upcoming AGI workshop next month in Vienna, Austria — the first at a major AI research conference.

“This really needs a community’s effort and attention so that mutually we can agree on some sort of classifications of AGI,” said workshop organizer Jiaxuan You, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. One idea is to segment it into levels in the same way that carmakers try to benchmark the path between cruise control and fully self-driving vehicles.

Others plan to figure it out on their own. San Francisco company OpenAI has given its nonprofit board of directors — whose members include a former U.S. Treasury secretary — the responsibility of deciding when its AI systems have reached the point at which they “outperform humans at most economically valuable work.”

“The board determines when we’ve attained AGI,” says OpenAI’s own explanation of its governance structure. Such an achievement would cut off the company’s biggest partner, Microsoft, from the rights to commercialize such a system, since the terms of their agreements “only apply to pre-AGI technology.”

Is AGI dangerous?

Hinton made global headlines last year when he quit Google and sounded a warning about AI’s existential dangers. A new Science study published Thursday could reinforce those concerns.

Its lead author is Michael Cohen, a University of California, Berkeley, researcher who studies the “expected behavior of generally intelligent artificial agents,” particularly those competent enough to “present a real threat to us by out planning us.”

Cohen made clear in an interview Thursday that such long-term AI planning agents don’t yet exist. But “they have the potential” to get more advanced as tech companies seek to combine today’s chatbot technology with more deliberate planning skills using a technique known as reinforcement learning.

“Giving an advanced AI system the objective to maximize its reward and, at some point, withholding reward from it, strongly incentivizes the AI system to take humans out of the loop, if it has the opportunity,” according to the paper whose co-authors include prominent AI scientists Yoshua Bengio and Stuart Russell and law professor and former OpenAI adviser Gillian Hadfield.

“I hope we’ve made the case that people in government (need) to start thinking seriously about exactly what regulations we need to address this problem,” Cohen said. For now, “governments only know what these companies decide to tell them.”

Too legit to quit AGI?

With so much money riding on the promise of AI advances, it’s no surprise that AGI is also becoming a corporate buzzword that sometimes attracts a quasi-religious fervor.

It’s divided some of the tech world between those who argue it should be developed slowly and carefully and others — including venture capitalists and rapper MC Hammer — who’ve declared themselves part of an “accelerationist” camp.

The London-based startup DeepMind, founded in 2010 and now part of Google, was one of the first companies to explicitly set out to develop AGI. OpenAI did the same in 2015 with a safety-focused pledge.

But now it might seem that everyone else is jumping on the bandwagon. Google co-founder Sergey Brin was recently seen hanging out at a California venue called the AGI House. And less than three years after changing its name from Facebook to focus on virtual worlds, Meta Platforms in January revealed that AGI was also on the top of its agenda.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said his company’s long-term goal was “building full general intelligence” that would require advances in reasoning, planning, coding and other cognitive abilities. While Zuckerberg’s company has long had researchers focused on those subjects, his attention marked a change in tone.

At Amazon, one sign of the new messaging was when the head scientist for the voice assistant Alexa switched job titles to become head scientist for AGI.

While not as tangible to Wall Street as generative AI, broadcasting AGI ambitions may help recruit AI talent who have a choice in where they want to work.

In deciding between an “old-school AI institute” or one whose “goal is to build AGI” and has sufficient resources to do so, many would choose the latter, said You, the University of Illinois researcher."

Despite campaigns at several facilities in the past few years, the warehouse on Staten Island still is the only site in the U.S. where the retail giant’s workers have voted in favor of union representation. Cracks emerged within the Amazon Labor Union ranks after it lost the votes at a second Staten Island warehouse and at one in upstate New York, spurring disagreements about the group’s organizing strategy.

Some felt Chris Smalls, the union’s president, spent too much time traveling and giving speeches instead of focusing on Staten Island, where the union still does not have a contract with Amazon. Prominent members resigned quietly or left to form a dissident labor group, which sued the union in federal court last summer to force an election for new leadership.

Although many of the union’s problems are internal, it also continues to face roadblocks from Amazon, which has resisted efforts to come to the bargaining table despite pressure from federal labor regulators to do so.

The company, for its part, has accused the National Labor Relations Board and the ALU of improperly influencing the outcome of the successful unionization vote. Amazon also claims the results – 2,654 in favor and 2,131 against – do not represent what the majority of employees want. About 8,300 people worked at the JFK8 Fulfillment Center at the time of the April 2022 vote.

“When the law allows management to drag out negotiations over years, and to use legal arguments to delay the progress that the workers have begun, it’s just an enormous hurdle,” said Benjamin Sachs, a labor law professor at Harvard University.

In January, months after the splinter group called A.L.U. Democratic Reform Caucus filed its lawsuit, the union agreed to a court-brokered plan to allow rank-and-file members to vote on whether to hold an election for a slate of new officers. For five days that ended in early March, tables with ballots were set up outside the doors of the massive Staten Island warehouse. Smalls and other union leaders campaigned against the election, but the vote didn’t go their way.

In court documents, Arthur Schwartz, an attorney who represents the dissident caucus, said that of the roughly 350 union members who voted, 60% favored having an officer election in June or July.

The referendum, which had a low turnout rate, didn’t settle the legal back-and-forth and internal power plays. Last week, Jeanne Mirer, an attorney for the union, argued in a legal filing that the federal court in New York should reopen the court-brokered plan. She called it a “flawed” agreement that violated the union’s constitution.

According to Mirer, the current ALU governing document requires members to pass an amendment or arrange a constitutional convention if they want to hold an officer election before a collective bargaining agreement is negotiated with Amazon. The current leaders also say the union has run out of money, which makes it challenging for them to conduct an election.

“It doesn’t matter who’s in the chair,” Mirer said during an interview. “Anybody who is a leader has to get Amazon to the table, and working against each other isn’t going to do it.”

Schwartz, the attorney for the dissidents, called the union’s legal claims “totally baseless,” arguing that the constitution at issue was imposed by Smalls – without a vote – in late 2022. He noted that the neutral monitor overseeing the implementation of the court-brokered plan – labor attorney Richard Levy – has scheduled candidate nomination meetings for May, which could allow an internal election to be held as early as June 11.

Smalls, a former Amazon worker who co-founded the union during the coronavirus pandemic, did not respond to multiple requests for an interview. Last year, he told the New York Times that he traveled to help raise money for the union. He also told financial news website Business Insider in December that he would not seek reelection as ALU president.

Meanwhile, two other prominent organizers, Connor Spence, the union’s co-founder and former treasurer, and Michelle Valentin Nieves, the union’s former vice president, have thrown their hats in the ring. Amazon fired Spence last year for violating a company policy that forbids workers from accessing company buildings or outdoor work areas when they’re off the clock, a policy critics say is designed to hinder organizing. He’s leading the A.L.U. Democratic Reform Caucus, while Valentin Nieves is running her own independent campaign.

Valentin Nieves, who helps run the conveyor belts at the warehouse that unionized, said she felt frustrated during her time as an ALU officer by how much Smalls traveled, alleging that he missed weekly financial meetings for five months straight. She said she spoke with him about reducing his time away and encouraged him to periodically go to public bus stop near the warehouse, where many workers gathered after their shifts ended. But she said Smalls didn’t take her advice.

“We need someone that is here. We need a contract and we need to organize the building,” Valentin Nieves said. “If we’re not able to do this, it’s going to have a domino effect, and a lot of Amazon workers are going to lose hope.”

One Amazon worker on Staten Island, Keanu Rivera, 28, said he voted in favor of the union two years ago and sometimes reads the emails he receives from the labor group. Rivera said he used to see organizers talking to workers all the time before the representation vote two years ago.

These days, he says there’s not much of that, a problem exacerbated by the Amazon policy restricting off-duty activity in work areas.

“It’s all Amazon,” Rivera said. “Amazon got the money to stall them.”

In addition to the vigorous legal pushback against the union’s win, the company has continued to spend millions on labor consultants who often try to persuade workers against joining a union. In 2023 alone, Amazon spent more than $3 million on such consultants for its delivery network, a target of the Teamsters union.

Last month, the National Labor Relations Board is unconstitutional filed a complaint against Amazon, alleging the company illegally attempted to disrupt organizing efforts by an independent union associated with the ALU at an air hub in Kentucky. Amazon spokesperson Mary Kate Paradis said that complaint was “without merit.”

“We will continue to defend our position as the legal process continues,” Paradis said.

Back in New York, organizers pushing for the internal election have their work cut out for them. They still need to secure a new mailing list for all the workers at the Staten Island warehouse, which has high turnover. Schwartz, the attorney for the dissidents, has asked the court to intervene so candidates whom the NLRB determined were illegally fired, such as Spence, can campaign in non-work areas of Amazon’s property.

“The hope of the caucus,” he said, “is that we really use the election process to reenergize people in the plant.”"

The toddler was attacked in the town of Basti in India's Uttar Pradesh after monkeys broke into the family home while 13-year-old Nikita was playing with her 15-month-old niece.

The monkeys then started tearing apart the kitchen of the home, throwing around food and utensils and terrifying the two girls, local news India Today reported on Saturday. According to one local report, the young child called out in fright after seeing the primates.

Thinking on her feet, Nikita then asked the home's Amazon Alexa to play the sounds of dogs barking. Upon hearing the barking noises from the device, the monkeys swiftly left the home, with local authorities praising the teenager for her quick thinking and instincts.

While the species of monkey involved in the attack wasn't specified, the monkeys may have been macaques or langurs, both of which are commonly found throughout India.

Monkeys may attack for several reasons, including territorialism: particularly males may become aggressive when they perceive a threat to their territory or offspring. Alternatively, monkeys may misinterpret human gestures or actions as threatening, leading to defensive or aggressive responses, and intentional provocation by humans, such as teasing, throwing objects at monkeys, or attempting to capture or handle them, can elicit aggressive reactions from the animals.

One of the major reasons that monkeys attack is food, however.

""Regardless of species or location, a major factor in monkey bites and attacks is 'over-habituation',"" Tracie McKinney, a senior lecturer in biological anthropology at the University of South Wales, wrote in an article in The Conversation in January.

McKinney added: ""When animals lose their fear of humans and become a nuisance, they are over-habituated. In nearly all cases of over-habituation, the main factor is human food. What people eat is irresistible to wildlife. It is nutrient-dense, easy to digest and is available in rubbish bins, unattended backpacks, or even directly from people.""

These monkeys were likely breaking into the family home in search of an easy meal, having learned that human houses were a surefire way to find a snack. If they had encountered the young child, they could have caused her serious harm.

In recent years, there have been numerous reports of monkeys attacking people and even killing young children in India.

Late last year, a 10-year-old boy died due to severe injuries from a monkey attack, and in 2022, a 4-month-old died after monkeys threw him from a roof.

Clarkson's Farm will return to Amazon Prime for its third season, streaming from May 3. This comes after the show faced calls for cancelation after its star's controversial comments about Meghan.

Clarkson received international backlash against his December 16, 2022, column for The Sun newspaper titled ""One day, Harold the glove puppet will tell the truth about A Woman Talking B*****ks,"" in which he expressed hatred for Meghan and a desire to see her paraded naked through the streets and shamed.

""I hate her. Not like I hate [former First Minister of Scotland] Nicola Sturgeon or [convicted serial killer] Rose West. I hate her on a cellular level,"" he wrote.

""At night, I'm unable to sleep as I lie there, grinding my teeth and dreaming of the day when she is made to parade naked through the streets of every town in Britain while the crowds chant, 'Shame!' and throw lumps of excrement at her.""

The column received swift backlash from social media users and was removed from The Sun's website shortly after. However, it still appeared in the print edition of the paper.

Over 25,000 complaints about Clarkson's comments were received by Britain's Independent Press Standards Organization (IPSO), the regulatory body for the newspaper and magazine industry in the U.K.

IPSO opened a lengthy investigation into the comments and column in February 2023. After four months they returned a ruling that in publishing Clarkson's commentary, The Sun had breached Clause 12 of the Editors' Code of Practice which deals with discrimination.

On June 30, 2023, IPSO chair Lord Faulks said in a statement: ""This was a serious breach of the Editors' Code of Practice. We ruled that in this article The Sun published a pejorative and prejudicial reference to the Duchess of Sussex's sex and breached Clause 12 (Discrimination) of the Editors' Code of Practice.""

""We found that the imagery employed by the columnist in this article was humiliating and degrading toward the Duchess.""

Clarkson addressed the column in two public statements prior to the ruling. Two days after its publication, he wrote on X (formerly Twitter) that he was ""horrified to have caused so much hurt"" and that his naked and shaming analogy was intended as a reference to the HBO show Game of Thrones.

The star then issued a longer statement on social media apologizing and explaining that he had sent a personal apology to Harry and Meghan via email. This, however, was disputed by representatives for the duke and duchess who said an email was received but was only addressed to Harry and was marked ""private and confidential.""

After the IPSO ruling, attention once again turned to Amazon Prime Video who produce Clarkson's Farm and The Grand Tour shows on which the presenter appears.

During an appearance at the Edinburgh TV Festival in August 2023, bosses for Prime Video revealed that its relationship with Clarkson was now complicated.

""There are lots of discussions going on, but the thing that's important to say is there is so much more going on to the show than Clarkson,"" Head of U.K. Unscripted, Fozia Khan, told the festival audience about the farming show, per Deadline.

U.K. Head of Originals Dan Grabiner added: ""No decisions have been made... It's a very complex topic, but we are not interrupting production of the current season.""

""I can't tell you what a phenomenon this show is and the impact it's had on the agricultural community,"" Grabiner said. ""We get messages from farmers around the world who just love the show, saying they've never really seen their world reflected properly on screen before. It's a hell of a lot bigger than Jeremy Clarkson.""

The executives did not confirm whether their relationship with Clarkson would change after the production and release of season 3.

Newsweek approached representatives of Amazon Prime Video and Meghan Markle via email for comment.

Google has a new edge against competitors such as Amazon and Microsoft: It's partnering with Arm to make more of its own chips.

Google announced its new CPU, named Axion, on Tuesday. It's following Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure in creating custom Arm-based processors.

The move is another step forward in Google's development of new computing resources. Axion is set to be available for Cloud services later this year. Google says Axion will improve performance for ""general-purpose workloads,"" such as open-source databases, web and app servers, in-memory caches, data-analytics engines, media processing, and artificial-intelligence training.

Apple is taking 45,000 square feet (4,181 square meters) in a new building in Coral Gables, a wealthy suburb just south of Miami, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private.

Apple declined to comment.

The company already has a smaller office in the vicinity, which has focused mostly on Latin America as well as the advertising business, including selling ad slots in the App Store. The firm is also expected to open a large new retail store location at the $4 billion Worldcenter development in Miami.

South Florida has been a magnet for the ultra-wealthy and their companies since the pandemic upended the U.S. economy, with firms either outright moving to the area or expanding their footprints. Amazon.com Inc. is looking for roughly 50,000 square feet in Miami, after founder Jeff Bezos moved to Florida from Seattle. Microsoft Corp. has also leased a new office in the city, in the same building that will serve as headquarters for Ken Griffin’s Citadel.

Amazon and Walmart both use over-the-top surveillance in their warehouses — and the ""concerning"" practice not only undermines the rights of these megacorporations' employees but also puts their health and well-being in jeopardy, Oxfam, an international antipoverty organization, said in a report released Wednesday.

The 52-page report, ""At Work and Under Watch: Surveillance and Suffering at Amazon and Walmart Warehouses,"" highlights survey data collected from 1,484 Amazon and 444 Walmart warehouse workers across the United States.

Amazon has 750,000 operations employees working in warehouses throughout the country, the company said. Walmart employs roughly 1.6 million associates in the US, according to a recent SEC filing. Tens of thousands of those workers are employed across Walmart's 200-plus US distribution centers.

Oxfam's report quotes several unidentified warehouse workers for the retail giants describing harsh labor conditions, including one Amazon worker who likened their experiences on the warehouse floor to ""slavery.""

""Amazon has been a pioneer in the area of worker surveillance and management in its warehouses, and Walmart, long known for adopting repressive practices to monitor workers, is also entering a new phase of accelerated technology deployment across its facilities,"" the report says.

Data from two recent surveys, funded in part by Oxfam — the National Survey of Amazon Warehouse Workers and the National Survey of Walmart Warehouse Workers — is included in the report. A substantial amount of Amazon and Walmart warehouse employees who were surveyed reported being closely watched by technology while in the workplace.

""As the data shows, although key differences exist, workers at both Amazon and Walmart are experiencing concerning levels of surveillance,"" the report says. ""Crucially, excessive surveillance is not simply disconcerting for workers; it also erodes worker rights.""

Amazon and Walmart slammed Oxfam's report

Amazon has disputed claims that it uses technology to monitor its warehouse workers, while Walmart said the report fails to accurately depict the company's use of technology.

""While we respect Oxfam and its mission, we have strong disagreements with the characterizations and conclusions made throughout this paper — many based on flawed methodology and hyperbolic anecdotes,"" Maureen Lynch Vogel, an Amazon spokesperson, told Business Insider in a statement. ""In reality, Amazon has made notable safety gains and enriched the communities in which we operate, providing safe, good paying jobs with health benefits and educational opportunities.""

Vogel went on to attack the research itself.

""Traditionally, researchers work to disprove pre-existing beliefs and biases, but the organizations involved in this paper did the opposite — they started with biases and sought to prove them — which is disappointing,"" Vogel said. ""We're not perfect, but we're making measurable progress and our employees' health, safety, and well-being will always be our top priority.""

A Walmart spokesperson told BI in a statement: ""Oxfam's claims are based on incomplete and misleading information. This report inaccurately represents Walmart's use of technology and Walmart's publicly available disclosures around data privacy and worker safety.""

Some 77% of Amazon and 62% of Walmart warehouse employees who participated in the Oxfam report said technology can ""tell"" if they're ""actively engaged in their work"" almost all or most of the time.

Similarly, 72% of Amazon and 67% of Walmart warehouse employees who were surveyed reported that ""how fast"" they work is measured by company technology always or most of the time.

In a seven-page response to Oxfam viewed by BI, Tessie Petion, the head of ESG engagement at Amazon, wrote that the organization's report ""illustrates a misunderstanding of what the technology in our facilities does and doesn't do.""

Related stories

""We do use technology in our facilities to help ensure the safety and security of our employees — it would be irresponsible if we did not take this approach. We also secure our inventory. Our facilities house hundreds of thousands of products that will be shipped to customers around the world, and the technology in our facilities helps guide the flow of goods through the sites,"" Petion wrote.

Petion continued: ""This is similar to technology used throughout the industry. We do not use the camera technology in our warehouses to monitor employees. Employees who have questions about how our technology works, or concerns about the data it collects, are always encouraged to speak to their manager who can explain it to them in greater detail.""

More than half of Amazon and Walmart employees said they've found it tough to make time to use the bathroom

Roughly three-quarters of both Amazon and Walmart warehouse workers surveyed by Oxfam reported feeling pressure to work faster at least some of the time.

""Being monitored this minutely takes a physical and mental toll as workers need to make decisions about taking breaks, eating, going to the bathroom, or even drinking water with their pace or performance metrics in mind,"" the report says.

Some 54% of Amazon and 57% of Walmart respondents said their production rate makes it difficult for them to use the bathroom at least some of the time.

""The conditions there are absolutely horrific,"" one Amazon warehouse worker in Alabama was quoted as saying in the report. ""I likened it to slavery because they care more about quotas and meeting production rates than actually caring about us as human beings inside there. I feel more like a number.""

Petion, in her response to Oxfam, called the assertion that workers don't get sufficient breaks ""wrong.""

""In addition to their regularly scheduled breaks, employees are free to take informal breaks throughout their shifts to use the restroom, get water, or talk to a manager or HR,"" she wrote. ""If there's ever a concern about a manager misusing productivity guidance or asking employees to prioritize productivity over safety, we immediately investigate and take appropriate action.""

The data indicates a move toward a 'really dystopian workplace,' an Oxfam director said

Irit Tamir, a senior director of Oxfam America's private-sector department, told BI that the research outlined in the report shows a move toward a ""really dystopian workplace where people feel like they're constantly being monitored and watched.""

Advertisement

""They are feeling oppressed by this cognitive tax on workers who fear this constant surveillance and punishment"" for taking breaks, Tamir said. ""And as a result, you know, I think these warehouse floors have become incubators of injury sustained by automation and surveillance, and workplace cultures of intimidation.""

The Oxfam report said that at Amazon, warehouse workers ""are assigned handheld devices or scanners that record, count, and measure every item they move during their day.""

""These systems measure down to the second the amount of time a worker spends not actively sorting, packing, or performing work — what is called 'time off task,'"" the report said. Those scanners ""play a key role in the surveillance machine,"" the report added, because they can lead to automated penalties for workers who fail to meet production targets.

""In addition, hundreds of security cameras are constantly monitoring the warehouse floor, ready to notify a manager when a worker is away from their station for too long,"" the report said.

Oxfam's report said ""little is known"" about the technology Walmart uses in its warehouses. corporate.walmart.com

When it comes to Walmart, the report said that ""little is known about the technology the company is currently using to monitor workers across its warehouses,"" though Walmart workers surveyed reported being ""watched constantly.""

The report said that the data from the Walmart warehouse-worker survey is the ""first of its kind to offer insights into the extent of worker monitoring at Walmart's warehousing facilities, and it captures vital information about the company's current practices.""

One Walmart worker quoted in the Oxfam report said the company's warehouse robots ""are treated better than human beings.""

Abby Maxman, the president and CEO of Oxfam America, said in a statement that Amazon and Walmart make ""record profits on the backs of warehouse workers by exploiting them through oppressive surveillance practices.""

Advertisement

Oxfam wants both Walmart and Amazon to commit to ""ceasing or significantly reforming their use of worker surveillance technologies to enforce unreasonable and/or unsafe quotas.""

""These are the two biggest private employers in the United States,"" Tamir told BI. ""So we are talking impact across millions of workers."""

“We’re not going anywhere. Unifor is committed to the hundreds of workers at Amazon who have signed a confidential union card and will re-double our efforts in the coming weeks,” said Unifor western regional director Gavin McGarrigle in the press release.

Unifor says B.C. law doesn’t make employers provide an employee count during a union drive, meaning unions have to guess how many signed cards they need before applying for certification.

If the signed cards represent more than 55 per cent of the eligible workforce at a facility, union certification is granted, while if the cards represent at least 45 per cent, a vote may be called instead, the law says.

Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said the company is confident it provided the board with accurate and complete information.

The union said it plans to re-apply to the labour board.

“Make no mistake: workers at Amazon in Metro Vancouver are closer than ever to successfully forming a union,” said McGarrigle.

Unifor said it has repeatedly called for changes to the B.C. Labour Relations Code to improve employer transparency during the unionization process.

“When working people are up against giant, well-funded multinational employers, we need more tools to help level the playing field,” McGarrigle said in the release.

The union first announced a union drive for Amazon workers in Metro Vancouver last July, and said workers began signing cards in October.

When Unifor announced its applications last week, Agrait said Amazon looks forward to working with employees to “continue making Amazon a great place to work.”

Amazon , TribalScale , Spot Pet Insurance, and DECIEM are among the first certification recipients, recognized for their pet-inclusive approaches to physical and virtual workplaces.

Article content

“With nearly 1 in 10 pet owners leaving their job to find pet-accommodating employment* and another 60% saying they’d leave their employer if work conflicted with their ability to care for their pet, leaders are wise to recognize the tidal shift that is happening with their team,” said Cerys Goodall, COO, Vetster. “The Pet Friendly Workplace™ Certification aims to recognize those companies already building programs to incorporate pets in the physical and virtual workplace, and help companies design programs that meet the needs of the modern employee.”

Approximately 70% of households in North America have at least one pet and the demographic of those owners have changed significantly. Millennials are three times more likely to have a pet than a child, which has HR leaders looking at ways to build an inclusive workplace geared to the needs of animal care. Four companies leading in this effort include retail giant Amazon, Spot Pet Insurance, a top provider of pet insurance services, DECIEM, a global leader in science-backed skincare, and TribalScale, a global leader in digital innovation.

“At TribalScale, our culture embraces diversity, fosters inclusivity, and champions flexibility in all aspects of our remote-first environment,” said Nicola Watson, HR Manager, TribalScale. “Recognizing that our employees’ pets are integral parts of their lives, we proudly extend our cultural ethos to include them. Pets aren’t just companions; they’re valued members of our extended TribalScale family. By nurturing a pet-inclusive culture, we not only enhance the well-being of our employees but also strengthen the fabric of our global community, because when every member feels seen, heard, and supported, we all thrive together.”

“Creating a pet-friendly office can be very rewarding, benefiting the mental health and morale of both employees and their furry friends. Spot’s office culture revolves around many puppy playdates,” said Scott Taylor, President, Spot Pet Insurance. “By establishing clear policies and guidelines, I encourage other businesses to create a happy and productive work environment that embraces the presence of pets.”

The Pet Friendly Workplace Certification is open to companies of all sizes who demonstrate a commitment to pet-inclusivity and are evaluated across four key areas:"

The Seattle company said Thursday that Ng, a managing director at the Palo Alto, California-based AI Fund, will replace a seat vacated by Judy McGrath, a former CEO of MTV who told Amazon she won’t run for reelection.

Ng’s AI Fund, which he founded in 2017, invests in entrepreneurs building artificial intelligence companies. Previously, he led AI teams at the Chinese tech company Baidu and Google, where the team he oversaw taught a computer system to recognize cats in YouTube videos without ever being taught what a cat was.

Ng’s addition to the board comes as Amazon, like other tech companies, makes massive investments in generative artificial intelligence.

In his annual shareholder letter released on Thursday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy suggested the technology could be the next big pillar of Amazon’s business, joining the company’s prominent online marketplace, Prime subscription program and its cloud computing unit AWS.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy released his annual letter to shareholders on Thursday — and yes, AI was a major theme.

Jassy said in the letter that generative AI ""may be the largest technology transformation since the cloud,"" and maybe even ""since the internet.""

Rather than move existing infrastructure to the cloud, which requires a lot of migration work, the AI revolution will be built entirely on cloud platforms from the beginning, Jassy said.

The average sales price for houses sold in the country was $492,300, as of the fourth quarter of last year. But you can find one for under $20,000 on Amazon—sort of.

Basically, Amazon sells everything, and it’s offering several prefabricated homes, ranging from a 7 x 20 ultratiny house for just under $14,000 to a 19 x 20 one for $19,000 (actually, make that $18,000, since you can apply a $1,000 coupon to the price). Of course, nothing is ever that easy. You’ll need to supply a few things yourself: a tract of land to put the house on, along with a power source and water supply. But the tiny home does come equipped with a toilet, a shower, and some cabinets—door locks too.

The listing isn’t new, but it has come into the spotlight lately after a YouTuber bought one and the video went viral. Between the original YouTube video and its secondary form on Twitter, the video has already racked up almost 14 million views.

The so-called house is shipped in a folded state. Once it arrives, you’ll have to fold out the walls (probably with some help) and ceiling to expand it to its full size. Furniture, of course, is not included.

It’s an unusual sort of place to live. And while it might not stand up to extreme weather, prefab housing has actually been called one of the most environmentally friendly ways to build a house, as it results in less waste and it can be erected quickly. The business of prefabricated homes is a bit more complicated—Veev, “a real estate developer turned tech-enabled homebuilder,” as TechCrunch once described it, that reached unicorn status, shut down last year.

The allure of the tiny home

Still, the tiny home movement has increased in popularity in the last couple of decades, as millennials pushed back against “McMansions” and housing prices soared—more recently being posed as a promising, albeit imperfect solution to the housing crisis. Fortune previously spoke to a 24-year-old who opted for a tiny home in her parents’ backyard and managed to save enough money to buy a $250,000 house; she also gained a TikTok following because of her tiny-housing lifestyle.

Amazon has been selling tiny homes since long before the pandemic. The first noted offering on the site came in 2017, but carried a much steeper price of $36,000—although it did come with heat and air conditioning. Those particular Amazon homes, though, are no longer available.

Amazon isn’t the first retailer to sell homes; Sears sold tens of thousands of houses via a mail-order catalog from 1908 to 1942. The offerings weren’t prefabricated homes, but kits that had most of the materials needed to build a house. Prices started at just $452 for those way back when. More recently, Home Depot began selling tiny homes and accessory dwelling units—one being a 444-square-foot, two-bedroom home that’ll cost you $63,000.

And if it’s not tiny homes per se, it’s builders building smaller homes, as Fortune has previously reported. Last year the median new-home size fell to its lowest point in more than a decade, census data shows.

But all in all, this goes to show that Amazon really is the “everything store.” From books to deodorant, apparel, paper towels, and groceries—you can add tiny homes to the list now."

The independent federal agency, which safeguards the rights of employees and investigates violations of the National Labor Relations Act, is taking on a legion of billion-dollar corporations.

SpaceX, Starbucks, Amazon, and Trader Joe’s have all taken swipes at the NLRB as of late. SpaceX has led the charge with an “I know you are but what am I” approach to allegations of union-busting by claiming the agency is unconstitutional.

Jennifer Abruzzo, acting general counsel of the NLRB as appointed by President Joe Biden, isn’t standing down to these corporate entities, and called out their legal tactics during a panel hosted by the Roosevelt Institute last week.

“A growing number of deep-pocket, low-road employers are jumping on the bandwagon, seeking preliminary injunctions in courts, solely to slow [us] down or prevent us from engaging in our enforcement actions against them because they have the money to do so,” she said.

These legal tactics are distractions to “divert attention away from the fact that they are actually lawbreakers who need to be held accountable in a timely manner,” she added.

Abruzzo described a back-and-forth that’s not unlike a David and Goliath story, if Goliath was simply trying to run out the clock and leave David high and dry.

The NLRB isn’t deterred, though, despite limited resources and a deluge of unfair labor practice filings amid heightened strike activity. “There is no way we’re going to succumb,” Abruzzo said, adding that the board will continue to call out companies where it sees fit—even among challenges to its very existence.

The main challenger of the NLRB, SpaceX, began its campaign against the federal branch earlier this year. Just one day after the NLRB issued a complaint against the astronautics company on Jan. 3, SpaceX sued the board in the Southern District of Texas, asserting that the institution’s structure was unconstitutional. A judge subsequently opened the SpaceX hearing in March, with a case expected to be heard starting in May.

Amazon, Starbucks and Trader Joe’s followed suit in the company’s crusade against the almost 90-year-old institution, Abruzzo said Friday. “These esoteric legal arguments came about, why? Because we dared to issue a complaint against SpaceX after it unlawfully fired eight workers for speaking up about their workplace concerns,” she said.

SpaceX’s pushback and suing of the organization “seems much more an ideological debate than how most employers handle it,” Matthew Bodie, a labor law professor at the University of Minnesota who was a previous field attorney at the NLRB, told Fortune’s Jessica Mathews this past March. “It just seems like more of a crusade, almost, than a rational economic response to litigation.”

While SpaceX is leading the charge, other large employers have eagerly taken up the same argument. Trader Joe’s argued that the board, in its current form, shouldn’t exist during a hearing in January over alleged unfair treatment of workers at its Hadley, Mass., store—its first in the nation to unionize.

“The National Labor Relations Act as interpreted and/or applied in this matter, including but not limited to the structure and organization of the the National Labor Relations Act Board and the Agency’s administrative law judges is unconstitutional,” Trader Joe’s attorney, Christopher Murphy, said in January, according to a transcript first obtained by HuffPost.

“I’m certainly not going to be ruling on my own constitutionality anytime soon,” quipped Administrative Law Judge Charles Muhl. “You’ll have to take that up with the Board and with the federal courts.”

Trader Joe’s—another of the companies taking aim at the NLRB—told Fortune the company “has not filed or joined any lawsuit that challenges the constitutionality of the NLRB’s administrative law judge system or seeks to dismantle any aspect of the NLRB.” It added that its statement during the January hearing was “an affirmative defense,” which “was not an argument; it was an opportunity to preserve all of our legal rights under the law.”

Amazon raised a similar argument in a case regarding the only Amazon warehouse to successfully unionize, in Staten Island, N.Y. Starbucks did the same in a post-hearing brief about some of its stores. Starbucks, however, has now distanced itself from Elon Musk’s raging brainchild. “Starbucks has not joined a lawsuit against the NLRB questioning its constitutionality or initiated similar litigation against the NLRB,” the company told Fortune, linking to a statement. As of March, the coffee conglomerate has 741 open or settled NLRB cases, according to the Economic Policy Institute—although the coffee chain recently reversed itself and pledged to negotiate with its unionized workers.

Amazon did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

Legalese aside, these major employers have been part of the ranks of companies answering charges of labor complaints by pointing the finger back at the NLRB. Whether or not they have called the NLRB unconstitutional or simply implied it, these employers are joining the Republican-backed charge against one of the only federal safeguards of workers’ rights.

But these corporate titans’ crusade isn’t meeting meek soldiers. “We are not going to stop despite these challenges,” said Abruzzo, noting that the NLRB is the only federal agency guarding the rights of workers to unionize. During a time of workers’ discontent, billion-dollar companies are seemingly attempting to make one of the few checks to their power go broke.

“It seems to me they would rather spend their money initiating court litigation rather than improving their workers’ lives and their own workplace operations,” said Abruzzo. She added the main goal is to “divert our scarce resources away from protecting workers’ rights to organize and to fight for recognition and respect for the value that they add to their employers’ operations. And that is not going to happen.”

The NLRB isn’t just twiddling its thumbs until it gets its day in court; rather, it appears to be fueled more than ever to tackle these companies and workplace violations. But Abruzzo conceded the companies’ efforts to draw attention to the NLRB are having an effect.

“Frankly, that strategy is working,” she said. “There’s a lot of public reporting about the challenges as opposed to the law breaking.”"

The big story

Amazon in the AI age

The generative AI revolution is coming, and Amazon wants in on the ground floor.

Andy Jassy, Amazon's CEO, identified the tech as the company's next big focus in his annual letter to shareholders , writes Business Insider's Ana Altchek.

Jassy described gen AI as Amazon's ""next set of primitives,"" which is corporate jargon for saying Amazon wants companies getting into gen AI to build stuff using their tools.

It's a strategy that's worked well for Amazon in the past. AWS, Amazon's public cloud business that Jassy helped create, has been incredibly profitable and upended how companies think about their tech strategy.

But there's a new kid on the block. The AI cloud includes Nvidia's GPUs and large-language models, which power the AI services and tools that are all the rage now. Meanwhile, the cloud 1.0 business, which AWS has long dominated, is no longer cool .

Jassy's letter details how Amazon plans to reposition itself at the forefront of this new era.

The three-layer approach includes Amazon powering companies that build and train models (Anthropic, Snap), helping companies use these models with their data (Bridgewater Associates, Pfizer), and creating customer-facing AI applications themselves.

It wasn't all AI talk in Jassy's letter.

I asked our resident Amazon expert, Eugene Kim , about what stood out to him beyond the mentions of AI. He highlighted two points:

A lower cost to serve. Jassy emphasized the company would continue to find cheaper ways to deliver items faster. That's a nod to the threat Amazon feels from fast-fashion retailer Shein . It also enables Amazon to increase its market share among customers looking for cheap, daily items that might have previously been costly for Amazon to ship.

Prime Video gets some love. Amazon's streaming business has been on a rocky road recently, with layoffs hitting the unit earlier this year . But Jassy's hopes remain high. He said in the letter he believes Prime Video could ""be a large and profitable business on its own.""

Exclusive content on the streamer has been a mixed bag . Its latest big bet is "" Fallout ,"" an adaptation of the popular video game set in a post-apocalyptic world. (Hmmm, what a novel concept .) Meanwhile, Prime Video's pursuit of sports remains a question mark .

Article content Their routes, the last step in a journey that can take products thousands of miles, are the source of a large chunk of the carbon emissions Amazon has pledged to eliminate in the coming decades. The solution lies in the parking lot across the street: 309 Siemens electric vehicle chargers, which power delivery vans built by Rivian Automotive Inc. Making deliveries without tailpipe emissions, and increasing the size of the electric fleet, is among the most straightforward ways Amazon can wipe carbon from its operations. In a little more than two years, Amazon has installed more than 17,000 chargers at about 120 warehouses around the United States, making the retail giant the largest operator of private electrical vehicle charging infrastructure in the country. “We’ve figured out the path,” said Tom Chempananical, who oversees Amazon’s fleet of last-mile delivery vehicles. If Amazon can show that it meets their climate goals while also meeting their package-delivery goals, we can show this all actually works Kellen Schefter, director of transportation at the Edison Electric Institute Logistics companies like United Parcel Service Inc. and FedEx Corp. have rolled out their own ambitious electric vehicle targets, though many have failed to meaningfully curb the growing emissions from e-commerce deliveries. Amazon, meanwhile, backed away from a vow to make half of all deliveries with zero carbon pollution by 2030, saying that initiative was superseded by broader climate goals. But the company has come farther and faster in the transition to EVs than most of its competitors. Understanding the challenges faced by Amazon, a company known for going to extreme lengths to meet tight delivery deadlines, can help chart a roadmap for other companies across industries trying to eliminate their own carbon bills.

Article content “Amazon’s scale matters,” said Kellen Schefter, director of transportation at the Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned utilities that has worked to connect Amazon to power companies. “If Amazon can show that it meets their climate goals while also meeting their package-delivery goals, we can show this all actually works.” Amazon has a long way to go. The Seattle-based company says its operations emitted about 71 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2022, up by almost 40 per cent since Jeff Bezos’s 2019 vow that his company would eventually stop contributing to the emissions warming the planet. Many of Amazon’s emissions come from activities – air freight, ocean shipping, construction, and electronics manufacturing, to name a few – that lack a clear, carbon-free alternative, today or any time soon. The company has not made much progress on decarbonization of long-haul trucking, whose emissions tend to be concentrated in industrial and outlying areas rather than the big cities that served as the backdrop for Amazon’s electric delivery vehicle rollout.

Article content But Amazon is on track to purchase by next year as much electricity produced by solar, wind and other carbon-free sources as it uses to power its operations. And in Rivian, which Amazon has backed with a massive investment and an order for 100,000 custom-built delivery vans – 13,500 of which have been delivered to date – the company has suggested it can eliminate much of the emissions associated with its last-mile delivery business. To get there, Amazon had to learn how to pick up the phone and call the power company. Electric utilities, which to that point primarily dealt with electric vehicles through powering the odd home car charging setup, encountered a new type of customer in Amazon. Government electricity use estimates show a 100,000-square-foot warehouse tucked in an industrial area might be powered by about 50 kilowatts, mainly for lighting and air circulation. Setting up 100 chargers in the parking lot could require 10 to 20 times as much power. “What was different here was this was a new type of electric use,” said Schefter, of the EEI. “That’s a really big power requirement in a parking lot.” That need could be met relatively quickly if the transmission lines in the area have spare capacity. In areas of the grid that don’t, upgrades can take years.

Article content Amazon also learned how to be flexible and how to wait. The company prefers cookie-cutter processes that can be run like a production line. That breaks down in the physical world, where Amazon’s hundreds of last-mile delivery warehouses come in different designs or parking lot layouts, subject to differing local utility protocols. “It was a bit of a surprise, how long we would need to prepare for the lead time for infrastructure,” said Chris Atkins, who leads Amazon’s logistics sustainability teams. In 2020, Amazon met with some of the country’s large utilities, who probed the company on how much power it would need and where. Representatives of Commonwealth Edison, Illinois’s largest power provider, were there. The utility, which was struggling to secure some types of new equipment during the pandemic, opted to repurpose old transformers for Amazon. “We were doing some pretty creative stuff internally to make sure that we had what they needed and that we could meet the timelines that they wanted,” said Diana Sharpe, who deals with large customers at the Exelon Corp.-owned company.

Article content By the time Rivian began rolling out large quantities of vans during the spring of 2022, ComEd had routed additional power to an Amazon warehouse in Chicago’s Pullman neighbourhood. Rivian’s chief executive stopped by that July for a ribbon cutting to announce the vans were hitting the road. Today, ComEd powers about 1,100 chargers at four Amazon warehouses in greater Chicago. Another lesson Amazon learned is one the company isn’t keen to talk about: going green can be expensive, at least initially. Based on the type of chargers Amazon deploys – almost entirely mid-tier chargers called Level 2 in the industry – the hardware likely cost between US$50 million and US$90 million, according to Bloomberg estimates based on cost projections supplied by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Factoring in costs beyond the plugs and related hardware — like digging through a parking lot to lay wires or set up electrical panels and cabinets – could double that sum. Amazon declined to comment on how much it spent on its EV charging push. In addition to the expense of the chargers, electric vehicle fleet operators are typically on the hook for utility upgrades. When companies request the sort of increases to electrical capacity that Amazon has – the Maple Valley warehouse has three megawatts of power for its chargers – they tend to pay for them, making the utility whole for work done on behalf of a single customer. Amazon says it pays upgrade costs as determined by utilities, but that in some locations the upgrades fit within the standard service power companies will handle out of their own pocket.

Article content When Amazon made the Rivian order, people who worked on the program expected that running an electric delivery fleet would eventually be cheaper than the company’s conventionally fuelled fleet, a hodgepodge of bulk-ordered gasoline and diesel vehicles built by the likes of Ford Motor Co., Mercedes-Benz Group AG, and Stellantis NV. It’s unclear if Amazon is there yet, though Chempananical said Amazon was happy with the price tag of the Rivian vehicles. “All of those costs continue to scale down,” he said. “As usage grows, there’s more demand, there’s more supply, it gets more efficient and continues to drive to a better spot.” It will get there. It’s just a matter of when and how we get there Tom Chempananical, who oversees Amazon’s fleet of last-mile delivery vehicles Amazon also had to figure out the logistics of charger sharing. That’s not an issue at the Maple Valley warehouse, where 77 electric vans have their pick from among a fleet of 307 level 2 chargers. But other sites have fewer chargers than available vans. Fully charging a van can take several hours, and at first, that created some headaches. Amazon initially required the subcontractors who manage van fleets and drivers to keep their own staff working overnight to rotate vans among available chargers. Last fall Amazon brought that work in house, freeing subcontracted workers to drive, rather than babysit chargers. “They need the drivers, at the end of the day,” Chempananical said.

Article content Amazon’s contract drivers say they love the vans, which were built for the company’s sometimes punishing, package-every-90-seconds routes and frequent stops. The people who employ the drivers – Amazon’s Delivery Service Partners – have some complaints. Two West Coast delivery service providers, who asked for anonymity to protect their relationship with Amazon, said body work can cost two or three times as much as conventional vehicles, because few body shops are authorized to work on Rivian vans. Spare parts can be hard to come by. Trucking presents a bigger challenge, for Amazon and the industry. Automakers are much farther along in electrifying cars and light-duty trucks than the tractors that haul shipping containers from ports and between warehouses (see Tesla’s semi truck, which is still in pilot production years after being unveiled). Bug-eyed Rivian electric vans are a common sight crisscrossing major cities like Seattle, Los Angeles, New York and their suburbs. But the communities that host the massive warehouses further up the supply chain, often poorer precincts in places like northeast Pennsylvania or California’s Inland Empire, have yet to see the same benefits of electrification. In the company’s post-pandemic cost cutting drives, Amazon has delayed and shelved some trucking-related and other so-called “middle mile” sustainability investments, according to a person familiar with the matter.

Article content Atkins rejected the critique, rattling off moves Amazon has made in the arena: buying trucks that run on compressed natural gas, and investing in makers of green hydrogen, among other fuel sources. “It’s important that we get it right and not just scale with the wrong partners,” he said. “It will get there,” Chempananical said of Amazon’s investments in the “middle mile.” “It’s just a matter of when and how we get there.” Back at the Maple Valley warehouse, Justin Shearer, who runs Pacific Delivery and Logistics, an Amazon delivery service provider, gives a tour of his corner of the facility. Like many of Amazon’s small army of delivery contractors, he holds another job. Shearer is a commercial fisherman, and earlier in his career he sold mining and logging equipment. He doesn’t consider himself an environmentalist. But the benefits of keeping oil products off the road are obvious, he said.

It's Coachella season, and some of the world's most famous faces are out to have fun.

The annual festival takes place in Indio, California. Its first weekend just ended, and its second is just coming: April 19 to 21.

The festival makes big money — according to Billboard, ticket sales come to more than $115 million a year — is a major cultural touchstone.

MDE offers a low-risk route to introducing profitable new business models such as split or sponsored billing, new package product offerings incorporating third-party solutions, automation for inter-partner manual tasks such as catalog mapping, and notifications mapping for service delivery to improve operational efficiency and the customer experience.

Mavenir’s Digital BSS has achieved platinum certification from TM Forum, with open APIs ensuring seamless integration with existing or new third-party systems and eliminating the need for resource-intensive system integration effort.

Sandeep Singh, Senior Vice President and General Manager for Mavenir’s Digital Business Enablement commented: “Mavenir’s Digital BSS is a transformative solution for service providers looking to stay ahead of the competition and launch innovative offerings in a fast time-to-market. Our arrival on AWS Marketplace is a strategic acceleration of our mission to drive sustainable global network automation and monetization, empowering the world’s operators to roll out advanced digital experiences at scale.”

He added: “By facilitating end-to-end digitization of customer interactions and streamlining collaboration with third-party partners – all within a stable and agile architecture – MDE Digital BSS provides service providers with a complete innovation framework to create seamless, personalized network service experiences for customers, and realize the gains with flexible monetization capabilities.”

John Abraham, Principal Analyst, Appledore Research noted: “One of the main innovation barriers for CSPs is the inflexibility of incumbent legacy BSS ecosystems, which require substantial investment in time, cost, and operational resources to enable new revenue models and service capabilities. Simplifying the path to the timely introduction of new business models and innovative best practices, as Mavenir is enabling with its MDE solution, provides CSPs with a distinct advantage in time to market and TCO.”

The MDE platform not only enables greenfield service providers to bring new services to market rapidly but also empowers brownfield service providers to modernize their legacy stack, accelerate digital transformation, and provides a viable path to migrate to 5G while co-existing with existing technologies (2G/3G/4G). MDE brings marketplace capabilities to service providers to cross sell 3rd Party Partner-led product and services integrated with CSPs and Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) worldwide. The platform uses advanced AI-ML engines to derive intelligence from customer and network data, which is then used to recommend new products based on historical behavior, and also delivers categorization capabilities that enable service providers to fully capitalize on their rich datasets – bringing new revenues and boosting customer stickiness."

Article content “Instead of using 15 keystrokes, it took three,” he recalled recently. “It was nice a little speed boost.” Three years later, and now infused with the latest version of OpenAI’s GPT-4 technology, GitHub’s Copilot can do a lot more, including answering engineers’ questions and converting code from one programming language to another. As a result, the assistant is responsible for an increasingly significant percentage of the software being written and is even being used to program corporations’ critical systems. Along the way, Copilot is gradually revolutionizing the working lives of software engineers—the first professional cohort to use generative AI en masse. Microsoft says Copilot has attracted 1.3 million customers so far, including 50,000 businesses ranging from small startups to corporations like Goldman Sachs, Ford and Ernst & Young. Engineers say Copilot saves them hundreds of hours a month by handling tedious and repetitive tasks, affording them time to focus on knottier challenges. Acquired by Microsoft in 2018 for $7.5 billion, GitHub dominates its market and is betting Copilot has the AI horsepower to fight off rival services including Tabnine, Amazon’s CodeWhisperer and Google-backed Replit Ghostwriter. GitHub’s AI assistant is also a kind of beta test for a host of other Copilots that Microsoft is baking into Office, Windows, Bing and other business lines.

Article content As is true with AI generally, GitHub Copilot has limitations. Developers say it sometimes pulls up outdated code, provides unhelpful answers to questions and generates suggestions that are buggy or could infringe copyright. Because the tool is trained on public and open repositories of code, engineers run the risk of replicating security issues or injecting new ones into their work, particularly if they blindly accept Copilot’s recommendations. GitHub emphasizes that the tool is an assistant, not a substitute for human programmers, and has put the onus on customers to use it wisely. Robust guidelines are required to prevent lazy programmers from simply accepting what Copilot suggests, said GitHub Chief Executive Officer Thomas Dohmke. He expressed confidence that engineers would keep one another honest. “The social dynamic of the team will make sure that those that are cheating by accepting code too fast and that don’t actually go through the process defined by the team, that code will not make it into production,” he said in an interview. Generative AI is the latest in a long line of innovations that have transformed computer coding over the years. Last century, program compilers accelerated software development by rapidly translating commands into ones and zeros that computers can understand. More recently, Linux popularized open-source coding, letting programmers leverage one another’s work rather than writing everything from scratch.

Article content Coding assistants like GitHub’s Copilot could be even more revolutionary because generative AI holds the potential power to automate large swathes of what software engineers currently do. For now, it mostly makes them more efficient. StubHub’s Avteniev, who also teaches software engineering at City College of New York, says Copilot’s predictive ability helps programmers stay in “the flow” because they no longer have to stop to look things up. Avteniev has been coding for more than 20 years, but even he sometimes forgets programming languages—forcing him to waste time Googling them. “Copilot stops you from having to exit your current coding process,” he said. “Even when it produces gibberish, it’s still easier to just accept what it does and then correct it myself.” Aaron Hedges, a developer for more than 15 years, was getting burned out before Copilot arrived. Hedges works for ReadMe, a startup that helps companies create technical descriptions of their application programming interfaces, or APIs. Like Avteniev, he makes good use of Copilot’s auto-complete function. “Because I’m a fairly senior engineer, I can look at that and go, ‘Oh yeah, that looks right.’” He also likes that he can ask questions without leaving his programming window. “I don’t have to shift away and open a browser, which can be really disruptive,” he said.

Article content At $10 a month, a Copilot subscription is a bargain that Hedges willingly pays himself. After work, he builds websites for Dungeons & Dragons fans. With a toddler and another baby on the way, leisure time is precious. “Those two hours I get to myself to code in the evening are super important to me,” he said. “The more efficient I can be, the better.” Few tasks are more tedious than debugging software—a process that can consume as much as 50% of an engineer’s time. Figma, which helps developers design app or website interfaces, says Copilot can create defect-testing programs in minutes rather than hours. “That is the real value of AI,” said Abhishek Mathur, the company’s vice president of engineering. “It doesn’t replace our work, but frees up our time to develop creative solutions.” Some companies are starting to deploy Copilot to create code for critical systems. Brewer Carlsberg uses it to write code for an existing tool that helps the sales force plan, prepare for and document sales calls. Mindful of Copilot’s limitations, the beer maker uses its own quality-assurance process to check that the code it has created works as intended, according to Chief Information Officer Sarah Haywood. Eventually, she said, companies will be able to outsource that task as well. “As time goes on, people will build more trust in AI,” she said. “I don’t think we should be having to double-check everything that AI does, otherwise we’re not really adding any value.”

Article content In an attempt to assess the technology’s accuracy, Canada’s University of Waterloo published an experiment last year. Researchers collected a dataset made up of code snippets that had known flaws and the fixes for those mistakes. The researchers prompted Copilot to create these exact snippets to see whether it would spit out the buggy versions. The assistant replicated the flawed version 33% of the time, less frequently than a human. In a quarter of the cases, the AI spit out code with the fix. Copilot generally was better at avoiding basic errors than more complex ones, said Mei Nagappan, a computer science professor at the school and one of the study’s authors. “The analogy here is that we are in an era of driver assist right now, not yet at the self-driving stage,” he said. Software engineers can be slow to change their work habits. Many welcome Copilot but are wary about becoming too reliant on it. A recent GitHub-funded study found developers accepted the assistant’s suggestions just 27% of the time. Engineers also can be quick to blame Copilot if something goes awry. When Etsy’s site crashed for short periods last October and December, some of the company’s developers fingered Copilot for the outage. Etsy confirmed the incidents but disputed that Copilot was responsible. “While we certainly understand that engineers may discuss how Copilot could theoretically play a role in outages or issues, we have zero evidence that the tool has actually led to any customer-facing impacts,” a spokesperson said.

Article content Copilot is expected to improve dramatically in the coming years. GitHub is already rolling out enhancements, including an enterprise version that can answer questions based on a customer’s own programming code, which should help new engineers get up to speed and enable veteran coders to work faster. In the coming months, GitHub also will let engineers use their employer’s own codebase to help auto-complete programs they’re working on. That will make the code generated more customized and helpful. GitHub can’t afford to sit still. At least a dozen startups are looking to disrupt the market. Some are leveraging new models that have dramatically boosted the amount of information code assistants can draw on quickly, making it easier for them to generate entire programs. “An AI programmer that can see all of your code is going to be able to make much better decisions and write much more coherent code than one that can only sort of look at your code through a paper towel roll, a small amount at time,” said Nat Friedman, an investor and former GitHub CEO. Friedman is backing a startup called Magic AI that plans to create “a superhuman software engineer.” Peter Thiel-backed Cognition AI, meanwhile, is working on an assistant that can handle software projects on its own. Princeton University this month released an open-source model for an AI software engineering agent, and it seems that not a week goes by without a new startup popping up. In interviews, few coders expressed fears that AI will replace them. As in many industries, they say, automation will free them up to focus on more challenging and interesting tasks. But Jensen Huang, CEO of the red-hot AI chipmaker Nvidia Corp., has a less-rosy perspective. He recently predicted that coding as a career is doomed. Now that AI is making it possible to code in plain English, Huang said, anyone can become a programmer.

At Fortune’s Brainstorm AI conference in London this week, Dr. Sunita Mishra said priorities for Amazon’s health care offering included transparency and ensuring customers’ trust.

Part of that, the Wharton School graduate said, is making sure there are no nasty surprises for consumers when it comes to paying for their essential medication.

“In the U.S. oftentimes you don’t know how much something’s going to cost until you get to the counter and then you get a surprise bill,” she explained. “We just didn’t feel like that was an experience that was acceptable.”

Amazon has doubled down on its expansion into the health care space following its purchase of primary-care company One Medical in 2022 for $3.9 billion.

In his shareholder letter released last week, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy made it clear health care would continue to form the foundations for the company’s growth moving forward.

He wrote that over the past 10 years, the company tried “several health experiments” which have culminated in the creation of “several important building blocks to help transform the customer health experience.”

The CEO of the Jeff Bezos–founded business added: “Because of our growing success, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutrition opportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, including Whole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.”

Mishra said Amazon’s health team was using large language models to help bring “lots of transparency” to the pricing of medication.

On top of that, the health care expert—who practiced as a primary care physician for more than 20 years—said Amazon was using AI to improve the workload of medics to give them time back with patients.

When asked about how the company—which has a market cap of $1.9 trillion—will look to scale its medical services, Mishra said: “We think artificial intelligence and generative models are going to be really valuable because if we can remove some of those things that clinicians don’t need to do, they’re going to be able to spend more time taking care of more patients. And so I think that’s the real opportunity to scale.”

“With size and scale comes responsibility”

Mishra said Amazon—which serves hundreds of millions of customers worldwide and employs tens of thousands of people—is also mindful of the powerful part it is playing in a highly sensitive industry.

And when it comes to integrating AI into health care offerings—an opportunity that has prompted warnings from the World Health Organization (WHO)—the stakes are even higher.

The Seattle-based company added a wider leadership principle in 2021, which will guide thinking when it comes to managing how the groundbreaking tech will be used: “With size and scale comes responsibility,” Mishra said.

“We never take for granted a single day that we have our customers’ trust. And I think that is even more so true in health care given the responsibility.”

Mindfulness of responsibility has seeped into how the company has designed its AI services, the medic continued, with checks built in to ensure safety, privacy, fairness, and accuracy.

Counter to the WHO’s fears, Mishra said AI could also present something of a do-over for biases already built into the health care sector.

Until 1993 in the U.S., she pointed out, female participants weren’t required by law to be included in clinical trials.

“There’s bias in our health care system today,” Mishra said.

“So I think there’s an opportunity there for us to partner with other health systems, other people in the ecosystem, to be mindful of that.”"

Now more than ever, you're more likely than not to be an Amazon Prime member.

About 180 million people had a Prime membership as of March, Bloomberg reported on Tuesday, citing data from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners. That represents an 8% increase from 2023, according to the data.

It also brings the share of US consumers who have Prime to 75%, per the report. Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

Online shopping, including from Amazon, took off during the pandemic. The new numbers suggest that Prime still has growth potential, albeit at a less rapid rate.

Prime fees, which cost $15 a month or $140 annually, are a key source of revenue for Amazon. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the company's subscription revenue for the first quarter will jump 12% to $10.8 billion; data are due April 30.

Other retailers are trying to popularize their own membership services, which offer perks like free shipping on online orders and access to streaming services. Last month, Target said it would offer Circle 360, a membership that provides unlimited same-day delivery on orders from its stores, for $49 a year.

Walmart, meanwhile, has been expanding its Walmart+ subscription program for years.

Some shoppers have still managed to avoid signing up for Prime. But in a sign of how engrained Amazon has become in the e-commerce world, even items bought on other websites, such as eBay, end up being shipped by Amazon.

Amazon is so obsessed with dominating the e-commerce world that it reportedly spent years gathering information about rivals like Walmart and eBay by selling products directly on their websites.

The tech giant started a company called Big River Services International as part of ""Project Curiosity,"" a 2015 effort to understand how Amazon's rivals in retail, logistics, and related fields ran their businesses, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.

Big River sold items like t-shirts, shoes, and beach chairs on competitors' platforms. Its goal was to get information from rivals that Amazon could then use to inform its own business decisions, according to the Journal.

Big River employees also went to great lengths to hide their connections to Amazon, even when talking to other Amazon workers. They minimized electronic records of their work, even when informing Amazon's top brass about what they found. Executives viewed printed copies of the Big River team's reports and weren't allowed to keep them, though they were allowed to take notes, the Journal reported.

The employees also used separate, non-Amazon email addresses when talking to other companies, the report says. They were even coached on how to respond if someone found out that they were actually working for Amazon, the Journal reported.

""Benchmarking is a common practice in business,"" an Amazon spokesperson told Business Insider, using an industry term for comparing itself to rivals. ""Amazon, like many other retailers, has benchmarking and customer experience teams that conduct research into the experiences of customers, including our selling partners, in order to improve their experiences working with us.""

After Big River joined a fulfillment program for e-commerce sellers operated by FedEx, for instance, Big River employees relayed pricing and other terms for the service to Amazon's logistics team, which then made changes based on the information, the Journal reported.

The Amazon spokesperson said that a review of internal documents has ""not identified any instances of an Amazon employee having FedEx pricing information prior to its launch or using such information to adjust our own pricing or pricing discussions with any sellers.""

""The information we have reviewed indicates that pricing information was obtained after FedEx launched FedEx Fulfillment on February 7, 2017, and this information was one of many pieces of information considered as part of pricing discussions,"" the spokesperson told BI.

Big River also developed its own brands to sell through rivals' marketplace websites. They include an India-based brand called Crimson Knot that sells photo frames on Indian e-commerce website Flipkart, as well as a streetwear brand called Not So Ape, which used a website hosted by Shopify to sell in the US, according to the Journal.

Amazon has faced scrutiny for its treatment of sellers on its own platform before. A congressional committee found in 2020 that the company had used data on sales by third-party sellers to create its own version of the products — usually to the detriment of the independent sellers and their businesses.

A lawsuit from the FTC last year also claimed that Amazon effectively raised prices by increasing what the company charged its third-party sellers and punishing them for offering lower prices on websites besides Amazon."

While most of the tech world is focused on shiny new generative AI tools, Amazon has been chipping away at an ongoing challenge posed by modern consumerism: the proliferation of shipping materials.

For several years now, the e-commerce giant has been developing what it describes as a ""multimodal AI model"" called the Package Decision Engine.

The PDE's job is to do a smarter job of selecting the right box, bag, or wrapper for each of the millions of unique items sold through the company's warehouses.

Retail workers' hourly wages have increased substantially in the last several years as major employers like Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Lowe's, and more have plowed billions of dollars into pay increases in a bid to get people to join — and stay.

Ever since Amazon set its minimum wage at $15 in 2018, more retailers have followed suit by offering starting wages that are more than double the national minimum of $7.25. The Federal minimum was last set in 2009.

LAVAL, Que. — A Quebec-based union says it has filed an application to represent hundreds of Amazon.com Inc. workers at a warehouse in the province.

The union, which represents 330,000 workers across a wide array of industries, says the tribunal will now have to ensure the union cards warehouse workers signed represent a majority of staff at the facility.

If the tribunal finds the threshold has been met, the union says it will be certified as a representative of all the employees covered by the application.

But the union acknowledged that it could face hurdles in its efforts to be certified.

It warned in a press release that Amazon has “a long history of union-busting and may well use delaying tactics or other strategies to slow the unionization process, such as artificially inflating the employee list, massive hiring and spreading anti-union messages.”

Earlier this month, Unifor filed applications to represent workers at two Amazon warehouses in New Westminster and Delta, B.C.

Shortly after, the union wound up temporarily withdrawing the applications and accusing the e-commerce giant of providing a “suspiciously high” employee count that stymied its efforts.

Amazon spokesperson Barbara Agrait said at the time that the company is confident it provided the board with accurate and complete information.

“We can assure Amazon employees that our legal teams are ready, and that workers’ rights will be respected,” said Caroline Senneville, the Confederation des syndicats nationaux’s president, said in the press release."

The app doles out points for watching videos and logging in, which can be used on gift cards and vouchers.

The rewards hub is for users over 18, but officials say TikTok isn't doing enough to stop minors from using it.

Digital regulators in Europe are clamping down on a new feature by TikTok that rewards users for consuming videos and interacting with creators, citing addiction concerns among children.

The European Commission said on Monday that it had opened formal proceedings against TikTok Lite, a spinoff version of the TikTok app that uses less mobile data and launched in Spain and France in March.

A key draw to the new app is its ""Task and Rewards"" program, which allows users 18 or older to earn points by logging in daily, watching videos, liking posts, and inviting friends to TikTok.

Users can earn such points on the Lite app by watching videos for up to 85 minutes daily.

The points can be converted into rewards like Amazon vouchers, gift cards, or TikTok coins — an internal currency that can be spent to send gifts to streamers and content creators.

But the commission said TikTok hasn't done enough to ensure minors can't access the rewards hub, and is concerned it can get kids addicted to the Lite app.

""We suspect TikTok 'Lite' could be as toxic and addictive as cigarettes 'light,'"" said Thierry Breton, commissioner for the internal market in the EU.

TikTok has until Wednesday to submit its defense, which the commission said it would consider as it seeks to suspend Tiktok Lite's rewards program in the EU.

The platform was also told to provide a risk assessment of its spinoff app by Tuesday. European officials previously asked for it to be submitted by April 18, saying that TikTok should have already completed the assessment before launching the Lite app. However, TikTok didn't meet the original deadline.

""Unless TikTok provides compelling proof of safety — which it failed to do until now— we stand ready to trigger #DSA interim measures including the #suspension of the TikTokLite 'reward program,'"" Breton wrote in a post on X.

In a statement to AFP, a spokesperson for TikTok said the platform was ""disappointed with this decision.""

""The TikTok Lite rewards hub is not available to under 18s, and there is a daily limit on video watch tasks,"" the spokesperson said.

TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment sent outside regular business hours by Business Insider.

The commission said it was most concerned about the mental health of young TikTok users.

Breton said the app provides ""endless streams of short and fast-paced videos"" that may increase the risk of anxiety, depression, and addiction among kids, echoing similar worries among lawmakers elsewhere in the world, including those on Capitol Hill mulling a TikTok ban in the US.

TikTok is already facing a separate set of proceedings from the EU aimed at its main app, also based on concerns that its algorithm and video feeds could produce adverse mental health effects.

The double crackdown was launched under the European Union's new Digital Services Act, which compels internet companies to regulate their online content on their platforms.

TikTok, owned by Chinese company Bytedance, is subject to the DSA's strictest rules because it's been designated one of 22 ""Very Large Online Platforms,"" which are classified as those with more than 45 million users.

The platform has seen sharply rising revenues in Europe in recent years, with annual revenue increasing 164% from $990 million to $2.6 billion in 2022, per its latest report from September."

Summer is approaching, and the competition for same-day grocery delivery is heating up.

Amazon is now the latest major retailer to enter the fray with a new subscription option for Prime members to get unlimited delivery on orders over $35 from stores, including Whole Foods, Amazon Fresh, and other local shops.

Starting Tuesday, Prime members can sign up for a free 30-day trial of the $9.99 a month service, and customers with a registered EBT card can use the service without a Prime membership for $4.99.

""We have many different customers with many different needs, and we want to save them time and money every time they shop for groceries,"" Amazon's senior vice president of worldwide grocery stores, Tony Hoggett, said in a statement.

The news out of Seattle follows a similar offering from Target, which launched its Circle360 membership earlier in April for an introductory price of $49 a year.

And the highlight of the Bullseye's first-ever paid membership option? Unlimited free delivery of groceries (and other stuff) via the company's Shipt service on orders over $35.

Of course, both are following the course set by grocery juggernaut Walmart, whose $98-per-year Walmart+ membership includes grocery delivery among its perks. Walmart, like Target and Amazon, requires a minimum purchase of $35 for the free delivery option. Walmart also offers a half-price option for qualifying recipients of government aid.

The company will even have a blue-vested associate put your produce and perishables right into your fridge for an extra $7 a month.

At $259 a year — between the $139 annual Prime membership and the $120 total delivery membership — Amazon's offering is by far the most expensive of the three companies.

Even so, considering the fact that 75% of shoppers already have a Prime membership, that all-in number might not make much of a difference."

Big Tech companies have been pouring money into generative AI startups amid growing public and business interest in the technology, but the investments have also drawn attention from antitrust authorities.

The U.K. watchdog said it was seeking comments from “interested third parties,” before deciding whether to carry out an in-depth antitrust investigation.

“We will assess, objectively and impartially, whether each of these three deals fall within U.K. merger rules and, if they do, whether they have any impact on competition in the U.K.,” the watchdog’s executive director of mergers, Joel Bamford, said in a statement.

Microsoft said it will provide the watchdog with the information it needs to carry out its inquiries.

“We remain confident that common business practices such as the hiring of talent or making a fractional investment in an AI start-up promote competition and are not the same as a merger, the company said.

Microsoft last month hired Mustafa Suleyman, who co-founded Google’s DeepMind AI research lab, to head up its consumer artificial intelligence business, along with the chief scientist and several top engineers and researchers from Inflection, his AI startup."

The online retailer has announced a new monthly subscription program that will offer (kinda) free delivery of grocery orders over $35 within an hour, where available. Prime members can sign up for $10 per month. (Prime subscribers previously paid $6.95 for orders of $50 to $100 and $9.95 for those under $50.)

Non–Prime members who have an EBT (Electronic Benefit Transfer) card can get the same benefits for $5 per month—with a 30-day free trial.

A trial version of this program launched last year in three cities, but with this announcement, Amazon is expanding the service to more than 3,500 cities across the U.S. Beyond Amazon-owned Whole Foods Market and Amazon Fresh, members can get deliveries from a variety of local grocery and specialty retailers, along with unlimited delivery on orders of $35 or more from Cardenas Markets, Save Mart, Bartell Drugs, Rite Aid, Pet Food Express, and Mission Wine & Spirits.

Prefer to get your groceries in person? Subscribers can pick up orders within 30 minutes, regardless of the size of their order—and receive priority access to the company’s Recurring Reservations option for weekly grocery orders.

Prime customers will continue to receive discounts both in-store or online, regardless of whether they sign up for the delivery subscription.

Amazon bought Whole Foods Market in 2017.

Amazon has been increasingly adding side subscription options for its Prime members. Last year, it added commercials to its Prime Video program, instituting a $3 per month surcharge to do away with those.

These add-ons have helped the company keep the price of a Prime membership relatively stable. The company last increased the cost of a Prime membership in early 2022, raising it to $139 per year."
