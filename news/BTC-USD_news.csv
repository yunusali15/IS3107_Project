Try refreshing your browser, or Activist Adam Arviv Announces Intent to Nominate New Slate of Directors to the Board of WonderFi Back to video TORONTO — KAOS Capital Ltd. (“KAOS”), a significant shareholder in WonderFi Technologies Inc. (TSX: WNDR) (OTCQB: WONDF) (“WonderFi” or the “Company”), today announced its intent to nominate five highly experienced individuals to the WonderFi Board of Directors (the “Board”) ahead of the annual general meeting scheduled to be held on May 21, 2024.

Article content KAOS’s call for change in the Board reflects its dissatisfaction with WonderFi’s lifeless stock performance and its failure to capitalize on its position as the only fully regulated crypto exchange in Canada. The current Board has overseen extremely poor performance as compared to other public securities in the global crypto space during the strongest bull run in history for crypto currencies like Bitcoin. The current Board has repeatedly refused to engage on plans to restore investor confidence, leading KAOS to this decision to nominate a more effective and engaged slate of directors. KAOS’ call for change has significant support from shareholders, and cumulatively represents approximately 22% of the issued and outstanding shares, including Mogo Inc. (TSX:MOGO) (NASDAQ:MOGO) (“Mogo”), the Company’s largest shareholder, which holds approximately 13% ownership interest, and with whom KAOS has entered into a voting agreement. KAOS is confident that new leadership will enable WonderFi to realize its significant upside potential and gain traction within the re-accelerating crypto marketplace. KAOS has recognized that the current weak leadership is not capable of capitalizing on opportunities in the marketplace and is holding the Company back, resulting in the stock trading significantly below its comparable peers and Company’s intrinsic value. “As the cryptocurrency market rebounds, WonderFi is uniquely positioned to leverage its position as the only fully regulated crypto exchange in Canada,” said Adam Arviv, CEO of KAOS. “Strong leadership is imperative to capitalizing on this opportunity and the current Board has not shown itself to be capable or engaged enough to lead the way. Rather than engaging constructively and identifying a path forward, the current Board has taken the approach of stonewalling its shareholders. A proxy contest was not our first choice, but unfortunately is now required if shareholder value is to be protected and enhanced.” “This need for new leadership has already been identified by a large proportion of shareholders and every day more shareholders are joining our call for change,” added Arviv. “I encourage the Board not to waste more Company resources and to participate in an orderly transition, given that change is inevitable.”

Article content MISSED OPPORTUNITIES: FAILURE TO CAPITALIZE ON STRENGTHS As the only Canadian crypto exchange listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, WonderFi has been unable to seize the opportunities presented by the cryptocurrency rebound. Comparison of WonderFi’s performance with Coinbase and other industry peers highlights significant divergences and underscores ample room for improvement. This failure is compounded by a lack of product strategy and fragmented brand positioning, eroding investor confidence and perpetuating value destruction. KAOS believes that a valuable asset with significant upside potential is being led astray by a weak Board and Management, squandering opportunities and driving the stock price far below its true intrinsic value. SIGNIFICANT UNDERPERFORMANCE Despite the thriving crypto market seeing double and triple-digit growth, the Company’s share price has witnessed significant value destruction this year. As of market close on March 26, 2024, WonderFi’s stock price performance indicates fundamental underperformance, resulting in shareholder value destruction when compared to similar issuers/assets. A comparison of WonderFi’s share price against Coinbase Global Inc. (NASDAQ: COIN), DeFi Technologies (NEO: DEFI), Galaxy Digital Holdings (TSX: GLXY), MicroStrategy Inc. (NASDAQ: MSTR), and Bitcoin (BTC), across three distinct periods highlights this trend: from the announcement of the WonderFi and Coinsquare deal, the close of the deal, and year-to-date. During these periods, WonderFi’s stock price performance was as follows: 33% return during the announcement period, 43% return at the close of the deal, and a decline of -10% year-to-date. However, when compared to the average return of the other five selected comparables, WonderFi’s performance exhibited a notable downward variance. The average returns of the comparables were significantly higher in the same periods, demonstrating average returns of 298%, 255%, and 67%, respectively.1 The Company’s missteps lie not only in its financial performance but also in its investor relations strategy, which has favoured issuing superficial press releases over substantive engagement with shareholders. This flawed approach has done little to increase investor confidence, instead raising valid concerns regarding the transparency and credibility of the company’s communication practices.

Article content SUPPORT FROM WONDERFI’S LARGEST SHAREHOLDER To ensure that WonderFi is on the track to maximizing shareholder value, KAOS and Mogo have entered into a voting agreement where Mogo will support the five nominees put forth by KAOS. This agreement is significant given that Mogo is the Company’s largest shareholder representing approximately 13% ownership interest and brings intimate knowledge of the business and industry in which the Company operates. Mogo was also the largest shareholder of Coinsquare, which was acquired by WonderFi last year. This alignment creates opportunities for decisive action in guiding WonderFi towards positive outcomes for the Company and all its stakeholders. POOR CAPITAL ALLOCATION TRACK RECORD In assessing the Company’s capital allocation practices, several areas of concern have surfaced. This includes a lack of strategic coherence in mergers and acquisitions, coupled with inadequate follow-through on integrating acquired assets effectively.

The haphazard integration of five acquisitions made over the last two years and the presence of multiple brands and platforms has contributed to market confusion. The Company’s recent announcement on March 19, 2024, regarding the acquisition of FX Institutions Pty. Ltd. in Australia is another example of a misguided go-forward strategy that has confused investors. This acquisition appears to be following the same pattern of previous ill-advised acquisitions under the current Board.

Significant impairments from past acquisitions have raised questions about the Board’s oversight. The earlier acquisition of three entities totaling $158 million by December 2022 resulted in impairment charges of $121 million, representing 77% of the acquisition value.

In 2023, two additional acquisitions valued at $74 million led to a 70% dilution of shareholder value, with a looming threat of further impairments. This pattern has contributed to an accumulated deficit of approximately $200 million as of September 2023. TUMULTUOUS TURNOVER IN LEADERSHIP Over the past two years, the Company has experienced a tumultuous turnover in leadership, with changes including the departure of the CEO, two CFOs, the CSO, and multiple directors. This whirlwind of personnel shifts at the executive level has raised concerns regarding the Company’s strategic trajectory and governance practices.

As recently as last month, there were discussions around another major change in management with the board and third parties.

Article content LOSS OF TRUST IN LEADERSHIP WonderFi’s shareholders have lost trust in the Board’s ability to protect investors’ interests and lead the Company into the future.

KAOS cautions the Board not to take any defensive or further entrenchment actions or attempt to delay the previously scheduled WonderFi shareholder meeting. Any sale, transaction or other fundamental change being contemplated should be halted until shareholders have the opportunity to vote for a refreshed board.

Considering the views of a significant percentage of the Company’s shareholders, the urgency of the situation and the likely disruption, distraction, and costs of a proxy contest, the shareholders request that the current Board carefully consider and do what is right for WonderFi and its shareholders.

All shareholders are advised the current Board may try to shift focus with an aggressive smear campaign to distract shareholders from the core issue of ongoing value destruction and poor governance. The only thing consistent about this Board’s actions is dysfunction. KAOS welcomes the opportunity to engage with fellow shareholders who believe that the Company needs better governance and a swift recovery in share price.

The CEO of Core Scientific, a mining industry leader, anticipates higher costs post-halving.

So far this year, miners have pulled in huge money while bitcoin breaks records.

Bitcoin's price has soared this year with ETF-fueled demand surging ahead of the April halving event that market experts say could deliver a shock to the supply of the cryptocurrency.

The halving is a seismic event for miners, and the industry and infrastructure responsible for bringing tokens online. After April, the reward given to miners will be cut in half, from 6.25 bitcoin per block to 3.125.

Adam Sullivan, the CEO of Core Scientific, one of the largest bitcoin miners in North America, said larger firms will have the advantage of scale going into the halving.

Sullivan expects to see the bitcoin network continue to spread out and decentralize, and smaller mining companies may have to look for more cost-effective solutions as infrastructure and electricity become more expensive and the rewards shrink.

""We expect to see more miners in smaller sites with lower power costs,"" Sullivan told Business Insider. ""While power costs in some developing economies may be lower than in developed nations, bitcoin miners must evaluate the relative risks associated with operating in these locations to arrive at the best outcome for their business.""

Following the halving, 6,000 mining computers will be refurbished and sold to miners overseas, mainly in developing-economy countries like Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Uruguay, according to a Colorado-based crypto wholesaler.

Developing economies tend to have shakier electricity grids, often driven by ""less reliable transmission infrastructure,"" Sullivan said.

More mining activity in those places could lead to more risks, increased downtime, and power interruptions.

Higher operating costs, in Sullivan's view, could be worth the bigger up-front investment if it means greater certainty for grid uptime and business.

""Lower power pricing with greater downtime may negate the benefits of establishing operations in those locations,"" he said.

Ahead of the halving, miners have pulled in record profits, according to Deutsche Bank data. Strategists wrote in a March note that bitcoin's hot streak resulted in all-time highs for daily mining revenue.

Still, as Core Scientific's Sullivan noted, the lower miner rewards post-halving can lead to an immediate reduction in profits.

""The last halving took place in May 2020, reducing the miner reward from 12.5 to 6.25 bitcoins per block,"" Deutsche strategists said. ""Miners saw their profits significantly reduced overnight. Many were forced to shut down outdated rigs that became unprofitable to operate.""

But even as it's about to become more difficult for miners, past cycles show that the halving event itself is jet fuel for bitcoin's price.

In the 12 months after the last three halvings in 2012, 2016, and 2020, the price of bitcoin climbed 8,069%, 284%, and 559%, respectively.

""The 2024 macro context is so favorable to bitcoin, it feels unlikely that miners will throw in the towel if they are remotely profitable,"" Ruth Foxe Blader, a venture capital investor with Foxe Capital, told Business Insider. ""Simply put, if the unit economics still work, then we won't see a significant change in the mining landscape."""

Article content “Our results this period demonstrate the strength and potential of the new Hut 8. Our thesis for the merger was to combine the operating scale and discipline of US Bitcoin Corp with the strong balance sheet, access to capital markets, and liquidity of Hut 8 Mining Corp. Since closing, we have focused tirelessly on driving efficiencies through a comprehensive restructuring program. While there is still work to do, I am proud of the progress we have made,” said Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8. “Our goal is to continue building a profitable, diversified business during fiscal year ’24. With this in mind, we will continue to focus on driving topline revenue growth and cost reduction across the business. “Looking ahead, we are focused on two pillars of growth: strengthening and growing our self-mining business, and continuing to diversify our broader business. We currently have more than 1,100 megawatts of energy development capacity under exclusivity, which represents nearly 63 exahash of capacity if filled with current generation miners. As we head into the halving, we maintain a strong balance sheet with what we believe to be healthy and manageable debt. This will allow us to invest in growth while reducing the need for external capital and limiting shareholder dilution.

Article content “We have already proven that we can operate at scale, with approximately 27 exahash under management across our self-mining, hosting, and managed services business lines as of the end of February. We believe our ability to build sites quickly and cost-efficiently without sacrificing quality is unmatched, and our team has a single-minded focus on building a best-in-class operating business. With our capabilities, resources, and team, I am more confident than ever that we will build a lasting, generational business committed to maximizing shareholder value.” Six Months Ended December 31, 2023 Financial and Operational Highlights U.S. Data Mining Group, Inc. dba US Bitcoin Corp (“USBTC”) and Hut 8 Mining Corp. completed an all-stock merger of equals (the “Business Combination”) on November 30, 2023.

Article content General and administration expenses for the six months ended December 31, 2023 were $37.6 million versus $10.6 million in the prior year period.

Net income for the six months ended December 31, 2023 improved to $6.2 million compared to a net loss of $81.3 million in the prior year period. Net income was impacted by the Company’s decision to early adopt ASU 2023-08, the new FASB fair value accounting rules, which led to a $32.6 million gain on the revaluation of the Company’s digital asset holdings in the six months ended December 31, 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months ended December 31, 2023 increased by 386% to $62.3 million from $12.8 million in the prior year period.

Article content Adjusted EBITDA In addition to results determined in accordance with GAAP, Hut 8 relies on Adjusted EBITDA to evaluate its business, measure its performance, and make strategic decisions. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, further adjusted by depreciation and amortization embedded in the equity in earnings (losses) from an unconsolidated joint venture, the removal of non-recurring transactions, the impairment of long-lived assets, foreign exchange gains or losses and stock-based compensation expense in the period presented. You are encouraged to evaluate each of these adjustments and the reasons the Company’s Board and management team consider them appropriate for supplemental analysis. The Company’s Board and management team use Adjusted EBITDA to assess its financial performance because it allows them to compare operating performance on a consistent basis across periods by removing the effects of capital structure (such as varying levels of interest expense and income), asset base (such as depreciation and amortization), and other items (such as non-recurring transactions mentioned above) that impact the comparability of financial results from period to period.

Article content Net income (loss) is the GAAP measure most directly comparable to Adjusted EBITDA. In evaluating Adjusted EBITDA, you should be aware that in the future the Company may incur expenses that are the same as or similar to some of the adjustments in such presentation. The Company’s presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that its future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. There can be no assurance that the Company will not modify the presentation of Adjusted EBITDA in the future, and any such modification may be material. Adjusted EBITDA has important limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider Adjusted EBITDA in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of results as reported under GAAP. Because Adjusted EBITDA may be defined differently by other companies in the industry, the Company’s definition of this non-GAAP financial measure may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies, thereby diminishing its utility.

Hi! We've got a new photo of a supermassive black hole that also provides some clues about one of the most mysterious parts of our galaxy.

In today's big story, disgraced crypto executive Sam Bankman-Fried finds out how long he's going to prison .

What's on deck:

The big story

Sam's sentencing

Chelsea Jia Feng/Insider

Bitcoin is booming, but a piece of its darker past is back in the spotlight.

Sam Bankman-Fried, the ex-CEO of FTX and former face of crypto, will be sentenced in a Manhattan courtroom today.

Advertisement

Bankman-Fried, more commonly known as SBF, was found guilty of seven counts of fraud and conspiracy last November . Those charges could bring up to 110 years in prison, but SBF's sentence, which is expected to be announced by this afternoon, will likely be much shorter than that.

Prosecutors are pushing for 50 years, while SBF's attorneys are asking for 6 1/2. The decision will ultimately fall to US District Judge Lewis Kaplan, who also oversaw cases between writer E. Jean Carroll and former US President Donald Trump .

But Kaplan's decision comes with an interesting wrinkle , writes Business Insider's Jacob Shamsian. Customers who lost billions with the downfall of FTX might get all their money back.

An FTX debtor lawyer told the bankruptcy court that FTX customers and creditors ""will eventually be paid in full.""

But according to some, FTX customers getting their money back is despite SBF, not because of him.

John J. Ray III, who is leading FTX through bankruptcy court, wrote to the judge that SBF left the exchange ""a metaphorical dumpster fire.""

And while victims might recoup their money, it comes with a big catch. What's paid out is based on the value of assets when FTX declared bankruptcy in November 2022 instead of where things currently stand.

That's a tough pill to swallow, as bitcoin's price has increased by more than 300% since FTX's bankruptcy.

In the meantime, life after SBF seems to be just fine for crypto. The long-awaited bitcoin ETF approval came just a few months after Bankman-Fried was convicted. Not long after that, the cryptocurrency hit an all-time high. And a halving event is around the corner that could push prices even higher.

It's a shocking turnaround for an industry deemed all but dead a few years ago. Critics pointed to FTX and SBF's downfall as an example of how crypto was only full of bad actors. Now, those betting against the market are losing big , and bitcoin seems like it's here to stay .

Investors looking to gain exposure to bitcoin should buy a spot bitcoin ETF rather than betting on MicroStrategy stock, according to a short report from Kerrisdale Capital.

The investment firm said it was shorting MicroStrategy stock and buying bitcoin as an arbitrage trade to capitalize on the ""unjustifiable premium"" valuation that MicroStrategy trades at relative to bitcoin.

According to Kerrisdale Capital's calculations, MicroStrategy trades at a valuation of $177,000 per bitcoin it owns.

""Shares of MicroStrategy have soared amid a recent rise in the price of bitcoin but, as is often the case with crypto, things have gotten carried away,"" Kerrisdale Capital said. ""The days when MicroStrategy shares represented a rare, unique way to gain access to bitcoin are long over.""

MicroStrategy has gone on a bitcoin buying spree over the past few years.

Led by its co-founder and Chairman Michael Saylor, MicroStrategy has amassed 214,246 bitcoin, or more than 1% of the total supply of the cryptocurrency, at an average cost of $35,160 per coin.

At bitcoin's current price of $70,814, MicroStrategy's crypto holdings are worth $15.2 billion. But the company has an enterprise value of $38 billion, or more than double the value of its bitcoin holdings.

And that's where the disconnect is, according to Kerrisdale Capital, which ascribes just a $1.3 billion value to MicroStrategy's underlying software business.

""In effect, MicroStrategy shareholders are now paying $177k per bitcoin when they could instead gain exposure to the asset through any of a growing number of ETPs, brokerages, payment platforms, and exchanges for less than half that,"" Kerrisdale Capital said.

With bitcoin now readily available to nearly all investors via spot bitcoin ETFs, MicroStrategy's allure as an easy way for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without opening an account at a cryptocurrency exchange is likely to fade.

""IBIT, FBTC, and a raft of other vehicles offer liquidity and ease of trading that will only grow in number globally. These developments bode well for bitcoin, but represent a secular threat to MicroStrategy's scarcity value and bloated NAV,"" Kerrisdale Capital said.

Kerrisdale Capital ultimately sees a potential 50% decline in MicroStrategy stock relative to bitcoin."

Article content “Having confirmed the tremendous performance of our T21 miners currently running, and with Bitcoin prices reaching all-time highs, we acted quickly to secure these miners at attractive prices in advance of anticipated hardware price increases. Together, with our 35,888 Bitmain T21 purchases and farm expansions announced in November, these new 87,796 miners are sufficient to reach 21 EH/s by year-end, with greater operating efficiency. “These orders solidify our expansion plan for 2024 and provide the pathway to operating one of the newest and potentially most efficient mining fleets in the industry. Securing these miners is a key part of our strategy to drive rapid and meaningful improvements across three principal operating metrics of hashrate, energy efficiency and operating costs per terahash as we plan to capture greater upside from rising Bitcoin prices and expanding mining margins,” added Morphy. Ben Gagnon, Chief Mining Officer, said, “In March, we received 1,650 T21 miners with 6,400 additional miners in transit. The majority of the miners received are installed and online. Garlock installations are now planned for completion in the first week of April. With curtailment in Quebec and Paraguay, as well as power plant maintenance in Argentina, we had fewer miners online than normal, resulting in a month-end hashrate of 6.5 EH/s. We expect to achieve 7 EH/s by mid-April.

Article content “As we enter the Halving, we remain focused on our 2024 transformational fleet upgrade and expansion plan which triples our hashrate to 21 EH/s, increases our targeted operating capacity by 83% to 440 MW, and improves our fleet efficiency by 38% to 21 w/TH. This marks the largest growth in the Company’s history and propels us toward becoming one of the industry leaders in energy efficiency. Bitfarms is well positioned, with a strong balance sheet, to execute on our growth plans and capitalize on opportunities in the upcoming bull market and beyond.” Mining Review March mining operations generated 286 BTC compared to 300 BTC in February. This reflects participation in grid-stabilizing curtailment programs, power plant maintenance in Argentina, downtime associated with facility upgrades resulting in temporary lower average operating EH/s, and a 4.8% increase in network difficulty.

The proposed merger with Kungsleden will put us on a new growth trajectory and transform our business model from a pure-play miner that is fully exposed to bitcoin volatility to a developer and operator of data center infrastructure, with a current focus on Bitcoin and an eye toward other end-markets like artificial intelligence.

Starting its descent from $71,229, the original cryptocurrency was hovering around $65,761 as of 11:40 a.m. EST, according to CoinGecko data.

So-called memecoins also sank, with Pepe and Dogecoin falling 8%, and Shiba Inu by 11%, in the past 24 hours, according to CoinGecko data.

One contributor to the slump is dampened interest in the nine spot Bitcoin ETFs that began trading on Jan 11. On Monday, the funds saw a net outflow of $85.8 million, the first since March 22, according to BitMEX data.

Daily trading volume has dropped to $5.4 billion, 43% less than its peak of $9.5 billion recorded in the first week of March, with continuous outflows from Grayscale’s GBTC putting significant selling pressure on Bitcoin prices over the past three weeks. On Monday, GBTC saw nearly $303 million of outflows, taking the total to about $15 billion since trading began, according to BitMEX.

In the fourth quarter of 2023, prices were bolstered by optimism that the Securities and Exchange Commission would approve the ETFs, and in the first quarter of this year, the trading of the products has stimulated growth, Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia International, told Fortune.

“In the last couple of weeks, there’s been the first slowing down in pace of inflow,” he added.

The recent slump and the decelerating ETF interest is also in anticipation of tight Federal Reserve activity, as data from the CME group suggests a 95% likelihood that the Fed will maintain target rates at its May meeting.

“The changed views about the Fed are having an impact across crypto, where there has been a selloff as the week gets underway,” trader Stefan von Haenisch told CNBC on Tuesday.

But Greco thinks there’s a third factor at play: a “pretty typical” price correction while approaching the April 20 halving.

“Bitcoin price tends to surge, have a correction approaching the halving, and continue surging in the months following the event,” Greco said. “What’s happening now is in common with past cycles.”"

“We’re not believers in crypto,” she said. “We do not think it is an investment asset class.”

“If you cannot assign a value, then how can you be bullish or bearish?” she added. The crux of her disdain for cryptocurrencies is the difficult task of valuing them, as they don’t produce earnings, dividends, or cash flow, the Journal reported.

Having guided thousands of wealth advisors, clients, and traders over the past 23 years in her role at the high-profile investment bank, she told the newspaper that clients are aware of the company’s anti-crypto stance and refrain from seeking counsel for investing in the space, despite Bitcoin reaching an all-time high of $73,737 last month, according to CoinGecko data.

Mossavar-Rahmani said she sees crypto as simply a speculative investment and doesn’t see merit in unregulated markets: “The rule of law and systems of checks and balances matter.”

But Mossavar-Rahmani’s stance is at odds with others in traditional finance, who are incorporating—albeit slowly—crypto into their offerings, and in contradiction to rumors that Goldman could be more crypto-friendly behind the scenes.

“Though Goldman Sachs might not have a developed view of Bitcoin or digital assets as long-term investments in portfolios, they are certainly engaging with the ecosystem from an infrastructure perspective,” said Matt Ballensweig, managing director and head of BitGo’s Go Network, in reference to the bank’s digital asset research unit.

The bank’s global head of digital assets, Mathew McDermott, told Reuters in December that he expects a “significant uptick” in trading volume of blockchain-based assets within the next year or two, and has also seen increasing client interest in crypto derivatives trading.

“Regardless of view, large banks are going to have to service their client needs, and we’re seeing that unfold now,” added Ballensweig.

Elsewhere on the street

Since the Securities and Exchange Commission approved 11 spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in January, two of the trading products have been issued by big-name asset managers on Wall Street: BlackRock’s iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT) and Fidelity’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund (FBTC).

Given the issuers’ access to mainstream investors and an established customer base, both funds are leading the fiercely competitive Bitcoin ETF race, with the funds amassing almost $60 billion in assets under management so far, according to BitMEX data as of Monday. Of this, IBIT and FBTC have accumulated over $17 billion and $10 billion, respectively—with the latter being the fastest ETF in history to reach this milestone.

Moreover, while Mossavar-Rahmani may publicly condemn investing in crypto, in January CoinDesk reported that Goldman Sachs was in talks to be an authorized participant (AP) for Grayscale and BlackRock ETFs, a role that involves creating and redeeming ETF shares to ensure the products trade closely aligned with their underlying assets.

Other Wall Street players have lined up to fill this role.

BlackRock’s AP roster includes quantitative high-speed trader Jane Street and JPMorgan, SEC filings show. Fellow ETF issuer Valkyrie has also teamed up with Jane Street and Cantor Fitzgerald to fulfill AP roles, another filing shows.

Meanwhile, that same month, the Nasdaq, CBOE, and NYSE Arca all filed 19b-4s for SEC approval to allow for the trading of related options, according to notices on their websites. On top of this, in February, CoinDesk reported that investment bank Morgan Stanley is allegedly looking into adding spot Bitcoin ETFs to its brokerage platform. The Wall Street behemoth is said to be carrying out due diligence on the products, according to sources close to the matter. If approved, Morgan Stanley would be the first among large registered investment advisor (RIA) networks and broker-dealer platforms to list the ETFs, potentially opening the floodgates for the likes of Merrill Lynch or Wells Fargo to turbocharge inflows.

“These networks and platforms are the addressable market for Bitcoin that the ETFs were always supposed to open up. We know of other big wire houses or advisor platforms that have approved some of these ETFs for trading already,” Bloomberg analyst James Seyffart told Fortune. “I think eventually the vast majority of platforms, if not all, will approve these things.”"

The US government has moved some of its bitcoin stash to Coinbase, according to a closely followed crypto wallet on the blockchain.

The crypto wallet is known to be held by the US government and stems from its seizure of bitcoin from the dark web's Silk Road, which was a global e-commerce website for illegal drugs, weapons, and other illicit activities that were facilitated via the transfer of bitcoin and was shut down in 2013.

On Tuesday, the US government transferred $65 worth of bitcoin to a wallet address held at Coinbase, according to Arkham Intelligence. The first transfer was seen as a test to ensure proper connection to the prime account at Coinbase.

From there, the US government followed through with a 2,000 bitcoin transfer worth about $131 million to the same Coinbase wallet. Earlier this year, the US government indicated plans to sell about $13 million worth of bitcoin following approval from the US District Court of Maryland.

Market participants closely watch the US government's crypto wallet for transactions, as any large sales could impact the price of bitcoin.

The US government's crypto wallet stemming from the Silk Road confiscation still holds just over 30,000 bitcoins worth about $2 billion at current prices.

This isn't the only bitcoin the US government owns. There is another US government crypto wallet that contains about 94,600 bitcoins worth more than $6 billion that was confiscated from hackers."

A peak in the price of bitcoin would be a bearish trigger for the broader stock market, according to a Wednesday note from Stifel equity strategist Barry Bannister.

Bitcoin hit an all-time high of about $73,800 on March 14 and has yet to retest that level. The world's largest cryptocurrency traded at about $67,600 on Thursday.

Bannister argued that the recent surge in bitcoin coincides with a dovish pivot from the Federal Reserve, but that linkage could signal an end to the current bull run.

""Bitcoin & NASDAQ 100 reflect the speculative fever fostered by cheap money after dovish Fed pivots, such as occurred 4Q 2023. We show that if Bitcoin reflects euphoria after a dovish Fed, it is notable that Bitcoin (and the fever) may be peaking,"" Bannister said.

Bannister pointed to a log chart of bitcoin with a polynomial trend applied, which shows that bitcoin ""appears to be maturing with major price peaks"" at around the $73,000 level.

Stifel

And if bitcoin did indeed peak, the implications are negative for the broader stock market, especially mega-cap tech stocks and the Nasdaq 100 over the next six months, according to Bannister.

A peak in bitcoin means ""weaker"" mega-cap tech stocks, a likely pull-back in investor sentiment, and the S&P 500 would underperform the equal-weighted S&P 500 over the next six months. That sets up for value stocks to finally start outperforming growth stocks, according to the note.

The big catalyst for a downturn in risk assets would be a reversal in the Fed's dovish pivot from late last year. That could be sparked by either strong economic growth or clear signs that inflation is still rising. In other words, the Fed's pivot that has helped boost stocks and crypto so far this year may be all bark with no bite.

""Without clear signs underpinning the Fed bullish shift in 4Q23, the market may have adopted a political interpretation. While we doubt the Fed pivot was political, it is investors' perception which matters more, and using that logic we show that recent poll differentials also support a pull-back for major equity indices,"" Bannister said."

Article content The planned upgrades will increase the Himalayan kingdom’s mining capacity by 500 megawatts by the first half of 2025, Matt Linghui Kong, chief business officer at Bitdeer, said in an interview. That would bring Bhutan’s total capacity to 600 megawatts. The capital will be drawn from a $500 million fund that the pair began raising in May last year, when they unveiled plans to leverage Bhutan’s abundant hydroelectric power for Bitcoin mining. Kong said he expects to close the fund by July. Reduced Rewards Bitcoin miners operate power-hungry computers that secure the blockchain, earning new tokens as a reward. These rewards are programmed to be cut in half every four years, part of the process of capping the total supply of the original cryptocurrency at 21 million coins. The upcoming halving in April will see mining rewards slashed from 6.25 to 3.125 coins per block. DHI and Bitdeer said they are confident they can maintain operational efficiency even if the price of Bitcoin declines post-halving. Bitdeer has one of the lowest costs per Bitcoin mined in the industry at $20,000 per coin, Kong said.

Article content Some miners went bankrupt during the crypto rout of 2022, when a combination of soaring energy costs and Bitcoin’s price falling below $16,000 proved a stern test of the sector’s durability. Bitcoin Rally The 140% Bitcoin rally over the past 12 months brought much needed relief to firms that survived, which are once again splashing cash on hardware upgrades and capacity expansion. The digital asset was trading at $68,581 as of 7 a.m. in Sydney on Friday. Computing costs are rising due to a surge in Bitcoin’s mining difficulty, a measure of how much computing power is needed to add a new block to the network. Network difficulty has hit record highs ahead of the halving, offsetting some of the gains from the price rally. Ujjwal Deep Dahal, chief executive officer at DHI, said the nation’s 500-megawatt boost “will be built on Bitdeer’s latest hardware to lower costs and improve computing power.” Singapore-based Bitdeer, controlled by Chinese entrepreneur Jihan Wu, is one of the top crypto miners by compute power globally and runs one of the largest facilities in Texas. Sandwiched between China and India, Bhutan has long sought to diversify its hydropower-reliant economy. DHI, which manages the government’s diverse investments, sees blockchain technology as a core part of efforts to build “an innovation ecosystem for a startup economy.” The investment outfit has been experimenting with asset tokenization and is also building out “Bhutanverse,” a metaverse project.

Article content “March was another productive month in our post-merger restructuring program,” said Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8. “We continue to make the changes required for profitable, long-term growth.” “On March 6, we announced the closure of Drumheller. Our team relocated efficient miners to Medicine Hat and retired inefficient miners.

We removed our miners from Kearney and Granbury and are relocating them to our owned sites, Salt Creek and Alpha, to be energized.

"{'id': 'cnn', 'name': 'CNN'}",Jeanne Sahadi,Made (or lost) money on bitcoin or other crypto last year? The IRS wants details,"If you’re a crypto investor or have been paid in bitcoin or other cryptocurrency for your services, you’re going to have to report your taxable transactions on your 2023 tax return, which for most people comes due April 15.",https://www.cnn.com/2024/04/08/success/taxes-crypto-digital-assets-bitcoin/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/gettyimages-1232542089.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",2024-04-08 16:30:27+00:00,"New York CNN —

If you’re a crypto investor or have been paid in bitcoin or other cryptocurrency for your services, you’re going to have to report your taxable transactions on your 2023 tax return, which for most people comes due April 15.

And — no surprise — you’re also obligated to pay tax on any income or gains you received from your crypto assets last year.

The wrinkle is that there are still questions surrounding the rules for tax reporting and the calculations needed in that reporting.

While 2023 was supposed to be the year, for instance, that third-party reporting requirements went into effect for crypto brokerage platforms to report on their customers’ transactions to the IRS, the IRS has hit pause on enforcing those rules until the Treasury issues its final regulations, said Miles Fuller, a senior director at crypto tax advisory firm TaxBit. Fuller previously worked at the IRS as senior counsel specializing in virtual currency issues.

Despite the temporary enforcement reprieve, you may have received tax forms from some third-parties. But even if you didn’t, you are still on the hook to be honest with the IRS about your crypto transactions. “It still falls to you to make sure you’re reporting the information,” Fuller said.

What you need to do

For starters, that means answering the question on the first page of your federal 1040 tax form that asks: “At any time during 2023, did you: (a) receive (as a reward, award, or payment for property or services); or (b) sell, exchange, or otherwise dispose of a digital asset (or a financial interest in a digital asset)?”

Answer “yes” if those descriptions reflect the nature of your crypto transactions. But you can answer “no” if all you did was buy or continue to hold a digital asset; or you simply transferred digital assets from one of your accounts to another, because those are not taxable events.

If an employer or client paid you in cryptocurrency: You will owe income tax on that payment — the value of which is determined by the price of that cryptocurrency the day you were paid, Fuller noted. While cryptocurrency is not legal tender, for the purposes of compensation it is taxed as if you had received payment in dollars. The entity that paid you may have sent you a W2 form if you’re a regular employer or a 1099 form if you’re a contractor or freelancer.

If you sold crypto in 2023: You need to calculate whether you had a capital gain or loss. In other words, what was the difference between the value of your crypto the day you bought it (i.e., your cost basis) and the day you sold it?

If you lost money, you can use that capital loss to offset any capital gains you realized last year — even if it comes from the sale of another security or another property, such as a stock or a home. Once you’ve offset any gains you had, if you still have losses left over, you can use them to offset the tax owed on up to $3,000 of your ordinary income in 2023. Any remaining losses left over beyond that can be carried forward and applied in future tax years.

Remember, too, if you sold bitcoin in 2022 during the so-called crypto winter you may have booked a big capital loss and can apply whatever you weren’t able to use on your 2022 taxes on your 2023 return.

If, instead, you made money on the sale or exchange of your crypto last year, you realized a capital gain. If you held that digital asset less than a year, it’s considered a short-term gain and will be taxed at ordinary income tax rates. If you held it for more than a year, it’s a long-term gain and you will be taxed at the lower capital gains rate — which, for most people ranges from 0% to 15%, depending on your income.

If you used crypto currency to buy a good or service: Say you bought a car with bitcoin last year. If it was worth more than $10,000 the car dealership will file with the IRS a Form 8300 reporting your transaction.

And you may need to report a capital gain or loss on the transaction. Say you get paid $10,000 in bitcoin by a client or employer. That’s reportable as income. Then say that $10,000 grows to $20,000 and you use it to buy a car. You will have to report a $10,000 capital gain too ($20,000-$10,000).

If you donated cryptocurrency to charity: The value is based on the price of the crypto the day the transaction occurred. But if you estimate the value to be more than $5,000, you must pay a qualified appraiser to officially calculate the value of your donation just as you would most other personal property donations over $5,000, Fuller said. “If you fail to obtain the appraisal, you can’t take the deduction,” he said.

What about investing in a bitcoin ETF?

In January of this year the Securities and Exchange Commission finally gave the green light for the listing and trading of 11 bitcoin exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

Currently, if you own cryptocurrency directly it’s treated as personal property for tax purposes. But if you decide to get exposure to bitcoin through an ETF, you won’t own it directly and the ETF is taxed as an SEC-regulated financial product.

So if you do buy a bitcoin ETF this year, you and the IRS will get a form from the broker-dealer where you house your ETF account reporting on your transactions during 2024.

What’s still not clear yet is whether, by owning a bitcoin ETF, you will need to check “yes” on that first question about digital assets on your 1040 form since you won’t own it directly, Fuller said.

Maybe by next January, when filing season for tax year 2024 starts, we’ll have an answer."

Thesis says Mezo is distinct from other L2s because it enables users to access applications that facilitate the use of Bitcoin tokens, promoting a circular Bitcoin economy—it can be more than “savings technology.”

“What I think distinguishes an economic layer versus any other chain is that it’s doing good for Bitcoin— both the money and the network. And then, it’s doing good for individual Bitcoin holders,” Matt Luongo, CEO of Thesis and founder of Mezo, told Fortune.

Mezo takes the otherwise inert Bitcoin holdings of HODLers and “puts them to work,” the company said, in a points program called the “Proof of HODL.” The longer their Bitcoin deposits are stored, the more a contributor’s “HODL score multipliers.”

“We want to make sure that people that have Bitcoin can actually run this chain,” Luongo said, and the longer customers use their tokens with Mezo, the more “aligned” they become with the chain.

For a user’s role in securing the network, Mezo provides yield—giving Bitcoiners something for doing what they would otherwise be doing: HODLing Bitcoin.

“Whatever happens on this chain is good for people that hold Bitcoin, and it’s good for people who use Bitcoin on the chain—I think that’s key,” he explained. “Anyone who’s ever really touched the asset should be able to earn on their Bitcoin. It shouldn’t just be something like a pet rock or something that’s sitting on the shelf, you know?”

Mezo was built to deepen the capabilities of the Bitcoin infrastructure by aiding cheaper and faster transactions without deviating from the network’s foundational principles, the company said in a statement. The permissionless layer—meaning a public blockchain with no restrictions nor central administrator—leverages a neutral smart contract infrastructure to offer a broader range of applications on the Bitcoin network, the company said.

The layer 2 will go live with ecosystem support from Thesis-built tBTC, which allows for “trust-minimized” bridging to various ecosystems. Mezo “highlights the immense potential of tBTC in making Bitcoin a productive asset,” Anjan Vinod, principal at ParaFi Capital, said in a statement.

“This feels like a breakthrough moment for Bitcoin as a technology, not just an asset,” Dan Morehead, founder and managing partner of Pantera Capital, added. “The Bitcoin community has been great at holding their Bitcoin for a long time, but they’re also ready to put their assets to work.”"

The original cryptocurrency has rallied more than 60% since the start of the year, driven by optimism over record demand for US exchange traded funds that hold the tokens directly. Bitcoin prices have tended to rise in the months after the three previous halving, which takes place every four years.

(Bloomberg) — Bitcoin’s “halving” later this month, a software code update that is being championed as a catalyst for further price increases, may already be factored in to a degree, according to the head of the largest US crypto miner.

“I think the ETF approval, which has been a huge success, has attracted capital into the market and essentially brought forward what could have been the price appreciation we typically would have seen three to six months post halving,” Marathon Digital Holdings Inc. CEO Fred Thiel said in an interview with Bloomberg TV on Tuesday. “So I think we are seeing part of that now already and that has put forward some of the demand. ”

Marathon, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has several mining facilities across the US including Texas. Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process in which such companies or miners use specialized computers to validate transactions on the original blockchain and earn a reward in the form of the tokens. The halving is set to reduce that reward, which is the main revenue source for miners, by half in late April.

“The halving event will reduce the supply of Bitcoin by about 450 a day, which would have some small impact on prices probably,” Thiel said. “But as miners we are very excited to go into a halving, where for once prices have not declined prior to the halving rather prices have gone up so everybody is obviously maximizing to that.”

Bitcoin fell for the first time on four trading sessions on Tuesday, dropping about 4% to $68,773. It is down around 7% since the digital asset reached a record of $73,797 on March 14.

Marathon’s Thiel estimated that after the halving, the firm’s break-even rate would be about $46,000 per Bitcoin to remain profitable.

Shares of Marathon were up less than 1% to $18.08 as of 3:32 p.m. in New York. The stock is down about 23% this year."

While crypto bulls are celebrating bitcoin's 2024 surge as the first leg of a blowout rally to come, not all consumers are as optimistic about the token's prospects this year.

According to a Deutsche Bank survey conducted in March, nearly one-third of global consumers expect the apex coin to plunge below $20,000 by the end of 2024.

That would represent a plummet of over 70% from bitcoin's current valuation, which stood at $68,652 as of 12 p.m. ET on Wednesday.

In stark contrast, some of the asset's most outspoken proponents have argued that it will punch past the $100,000 threshold in the same timeframe.

For instance, it's a view long put out by Standard Chartered analyst Geoff Kendrick, who also anticipates the coin to reach as high as $200,000 next year. Bernstein strategists have also ratcheted up their outlook, expecting a $150,000 valuation by 2025.

It's an optimism that's chiefly sprung out from this year's approval of spot bitcoin ETFs, considered as a major amplifier for crypto demand. Already, these funds have helped propel the currency 63% year-to-date.

Meanwhile, this month's anticipated halving event will lower bitcoin output, putting upside pressure on its price.

Rising adoption is why crypto billionaire Mike Novogratz expects $50,000 to be bitcoin's newest price floor, a level it's unlikely to revisit, he said in March.

But according to the survey, only 10% of consumers see the token reaching past $75,000 this year. That would be just over the $73,000 peak bitcoin reached in last month, before paring gains.

The price pessimism could be explained by the fact that 38% of respondents expect bitcoin to ""disappear"" in the next few years, just below 40% who believe it will thrive."

Mining difficulty, a measure of computing power to create fresh tokens, reached a record high on Wednesday. The latest bi-weekly update is the last reading before the “halving” set to take place on or around April 20. That figure has jumped by nearly 600% since the last halving in 2020, according to data compiled by btc.com, while the rate of energy consumption is seeing a rapid rise over the same period.

(Bloomberg) — Bitcoin miners are generating more computing power than ever to mint the cryptocurrency ahead of a code adjustment within two weeks that will dramatically reduce revenue for the companies.

Article content

Called the halving, the anonymous Bitcoin creator or creators known as Satoshi Nakamoto pre-programed the event into the code of the original cryptocurrency to maintain the hard cap of 21 million tokens to keep it from becoming inflationary. The amount of new tokens, or Bitcoin rewards, issued to miners is reduced by 50% every four years.

That spells trouble for the miners since the vast majority of their revenue stems from the Bitcoin rewards. This month’s event is the fourth halving since 2012 and the reward will drop to 3.125 for the miners that successfully process a unit of transaction data on the blockchain. The daily production of coins from all miners will be down to 450 per day from 900.

Bitcoin mining companies are boosting their cash reserves to cope with the negative impact from the halving through a variety of channels including running their operations at full capacity or expanding them to produce and sell more coins amid soaring Bitcoin prices in the latest rally.

Shares of Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., the large publicly-traded miner, were little change at around $17.50 on Thursday. Smaller rival Riot Platforms Inc. was also little changed at about $9.86. Marathon has gained around 70% in the past year, while Riot has declined 20%."

But even as the total trading volume of the asset class passed $200 billion, Jan van Eck, CEO of asset manager VanEck, one of the major issuers, said that Bitcoin ETFs are still in their infancy.

Speaking to Fortune on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week, van Eck said brokerage platforms aren’t yet allowing advisors to recommend Bitcoin ETFs, though there have been reports that firms such as Morgan Stanley are evaluating them. “Those are our biggest customer bases,” van Eck told Fortune. “So there’s a long ways to go.”

For now, the demand has mainly come from retail customers, although he expects that to change as platforms gain approval to start pushing Bitcoin ETFs. “Paper moves first in this world, and then decisions get made,” van Eck said, predicting that the shift could come this quarter.

‘Don’t get disrupted’

Founded by van Eck’s father in 1955, VanEck has long been at the forefront of alternative assets. John van Eck pivoted to gold investing as he worried about inflation, launching the first U.S. gold stock fund in 1968. “If you’re running a business, you’ve got to make sure that you don’t get disrupted,” his son told Fortune.

In 2017, VanEck became the first ETF issuer to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF, a few years after the Winklevoss-led Gemini applied for one in 2013. The Securities and Exchange Commission rejected potential issuers, with the approval process eventually moving forward after crypto firm Grayscale sued the agency to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF.

Now, with seven companies, including VanEck, applying for a spot Ethereum ETF, van Eck expressed skepticism that the agency would move forward with an approval. “Paperwork usually precedes action from a regulator,” he said. “And there’s no paperwork movements.”

He added that another lawsuit likely would be necessary to push the agency for approval, but there may be less appetite among stakeholders for another lengthy court battle.

‘People thought they were totally crazy’

With a crowded field of 12 Bitcoin ETFs, the question is whether the field will consolidate, with some issuers pulling out or acquiring competitors. VanEck is currently middle of the pack with around $600 million in assets under management, and BlackRock and Fidelity running away with the field.

Despite his firm’s slower start, van Eck said he’s been pleased with the progress. “We’d love to have $600 million in an ETF in its first three months,” he told Fortune. “The chances of that happening statistically in the ETF industry is probably 1%.” Still, he cautioned that because of the low management fees many of the issuers are charging, the vehicles won’t be profit drivers.

Another question is whether issuers will branch out to other custodians, after every firm, with the exception of VanEck, initially chose Coinbase. VanEck instead went with Gemini, which van Eck said was a “tip of the hat” to the firm being the first to apply for a Bitcoin ETF. “People thought they were totally crazy when they filed,” he told Fortune. He added that the firm would soon add a backup custodian.

VanEck is also expanding into other areas of crypto. In early April, van Eck’s son, Nick, announced the launch of his own digital asset firm, a stablecoin company called Agora. His father’s company would serve as the manager of its reserves, similar to how Cantor Fitzgerald holds U.S. Treasuries for Tether.

Despite Tether’s dominance in the stablecoin landscape, van Eck said there’s room for competition, especially with Tether’s wildcat status in the U.S. “A lot of firms are going through regulatory approval,” he told Fortune. “There’s plenty of room for exchanges to use other stables.”"

Article content Around April 20, the halving will cut the amount of Bitcoin that “miners” can earn each day for validating transactions to 450 from 900 now. Based on Bitcoin’s current price, it could spell revenue losses of around $10 billion a year for the industry as a whole. Marathon Digital Holdings Inc., CleanSpark Inc. and other miners, which compete for a fixed Bitcoin reward by solving mathematical puzzles using superfast computers, have invested in new equipment and sought to buy smaller rivals in an attempt to cushion the drop-off in revenue. “This is the final push for miners to squeeze out as much revenue as they can before their production takes a big hit,” said Matthew Kimmell, a digital asset analyst at CoinShares. “With revenues across the board decreasing overnight, the strategic response of each miner, and how they adapt, could well determine who comes out ahead and who gets left behind.” Granted, Bitcoin has reached new highs after previous halvings, helping to mitigate the periodic drop in mining rewards and the increase in the cost of doing business. The event this month is coming after the digital currency has more than quadrupled since November 2022. Yet the margin of success for the industry keeps getting finer. Miners will need to continually spend more money in a never-ending, technological arms race for smaller rewards. And while the energy-intensive validation process has always made mining expensive, companies now face even more competition for power from the burgeoning and deep-pocketed artificial intelligence industry.

Article content The soaring price of Bitcoin has helped offset those power costs and fueled growth in crypto mining. Since the first specialized machines came into play in 2013, the aggregate market cap of 14 U.S.-listed miners has grown to about $20 billion, according to an April 1 report by JPMorgan Chase & Co. While US-listed miners are the face of the industry, they account for just about 20% of the sector’s computing power, according to crypto researcher TheMinerMag. Private miners make up the rest and could be more vulnerable after the halving as they typically must tap debt financing or venture capital to cover their needs, whereas public companies can raise funds via share sales.

Total short interest, the dollar value of the shares borrowed and sold by bearish traders, stood at about $2 billion as of April 11, according to an estimate from S3 Partners LLC. That short interest accounted for almost 15% of the group’s outstanding shares — three times more than the US average of 4.75%, said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3.

Article content The update, the fourth since 2012, was preprogrammed by the anonymous Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto to maintain the hard cap of 21 million tokens to keep it from becoming inflationary as a currency. The situation differs from four years ago when Bitcoin was trading under $9,000 and most of the mining activity took place in China. Since then, much of that activity has shifted to the US, driving competition for electricity. “Power in the US is extraordinarily constrained,” said Adam Sullivan, chief executive officer at Austin, Texas-based Core Scientific Inc., one of the largest public Bitcoin mining companies. “Right now, miners are competing against some of the largest tech companies in the world, who are trying to find space for data centers, which are high energy consumers too.” The nascent AI industry is drawing in massive amounts of capital, which is making it harder for miners to secure favorable electricity rates with utility companies. Amazon.com Inc. is set to spend almost $150 billion on data centers, while Blackstone is building a $25 billion empire of centers. Google Inc. and Microsoft Corp. are also making hefty investments.

Utilities consider tech companies as more reliable purchasers given their strong balance sheets, said Taras Kulyk, CEO at crypto-mining services provider SunnyDigital. With that competition in place, low-cost power contracts could be tougher to renew when existing agreements expire. Large-scale Bitcoin miners tend to lock in energy prices, typically for a few years, said Greg Beard, CEO of public Bitcoin miner Stronghold Digital Mining Inc.

Article content The more computing power a miner has, the more likely it is to earn the reward. But it’s getting harder. Mining difficulty, a measure of computing power to mine Bitcoin, has swelled almost sixfold since the 2020 halving, according to a biweekly update from crypto-mining website btc.com. That is a result of an increasing number of miners and a reward that remains fixed. Companies have been updating their technology with more efficient machines to generate extra computing power, and public Bitcoin miners have raised billions of dollars to fund the purchases by offering new shares. That option isn’t available to private mining businesses, which account for about 80% of the industry’s computing power in the US. During the previous bull run in 2021, those companies mostly relied on issuing debt to help cover their costs. Both public and private miners were estimated to have borrowed as much as $4 billion in loans backed by mining equipment around that time. But deals have been harder to come by as a slew of lenders went bankrupt during the crypto market crash in 2022. “It is tough out there,” said Young Cho, CEO at Blockhouse Digital, an asset management firm that specializes in collateralized lending and yield-generating strategies in the crypto markets. “Miners have been looking for lenders for several months and they have not been able to find any.” Besides debt financing, some private miners are raising money through venture capital funding rounds, Bitcoin Opportunity Fund’s Foley said. Those with negative cash flows that don’t have access to borrowing are faced with the decision to finance operations through private equity or the cash preemptively stowed on their balance sheet, said Kimmell at CoinShares. “Alternatively, if they have low confidence in future mining revenues, they may wind up exiting the market,” he said.

The price of bitcoin is being sent higher by a rally among investors with a fear of missing out, and the token could plummet back to a level closer to $30,000 as the enthusiasm fades, according to Mizuho Securities' analyst Dan Dolev.

Speaking to CNBC on Friday, Dolev cautioned investors against buying into bitcoin's latest surge, with the price of crypto token soaring 48% to record highs since the start of the year. That's because interest in the crypto is about to fade, which could cause the price to tank to as low as $30,000, he warned, implying as much as a 54% loss from levels on Monday around $64,750.

The price of bitcoin could eventually plunge as low as $20,000 in the next ""ice age"" for crypto, Dolev added. That would mark a 69% drop from current levels.

""Right now it's doing well, but I still think longer-term it has no yield support, it's basically just FOMO, and I think eventually it's going to go down. I think eventually this is going to unravel that there's really nothing there,"" Dolev said. ""I see no value in it personally, so it probably goes back to the 40s or 30s, easily.""

Bitcoin has climbed higher in recent months on enthusiasm and demand generated by the nearly dozen spot bitcoin ETFs that were approved in January, as well as crypto's next ""halving"" event and the prospect of Fed rate cuts this year.

But Fed rate cut expectations have been dialed back significantly amid hotter-than-expected inflation prints, which means central bankers look poised to keep rates higher for longer to fight inflation. Markets are now pricing in an 84% chance the Fed will only cut rates two times or less this year, according to the CME FedWatch tool.

Bitcoin has dropped by about 9% over the last week.

Dolev's forecast is contrary to those from bitcoin bulls, who have said the crypto token has more room to soar this year. The token's latest rally suggests that bitcoin could climb as high as $150,000 by mid-2025, Bernstein analysts recently predicted, implying 129% upside from current levels."

Article content “With Salt Creek, we gain critical control over our miner fleet and operating costs as we head into the halving,” said Asher Genoot, CEO of Hut 8. “Our outlook on energy prices at the site suggests that the potential for cost savings relative to our cost of mining at Kearney and Granbury is in line with the 30% reduction initially projected.” As previously announced, Hut 8 relocated a portion of its most efficient hosted miners from Kearney and Granbury to Salt Creek in March to enable rapid energization of the new site. Hut 8 has deployed Reactor, its proprietary energy curtailment software, to automate site operations, ensure that miners hash when profitable, and reduce the site’s realized cost of energy. “I am incredibly proud of our team for delivering a standard-setting performance at Salt Creek,” said Genoot. “What we have achieved in 78 days, including the removal of more than 25,000 miners from Kearney and Granbury in eight days, is a testament to our market-leading capabilities, work ethic, and ability to execute. We remain on track to deliver an incredibly cost-effective buildout: Our expected all-in cost of $275,000 per megawatt or less represents a 40% savings versus recent acquisitions in the area. As demonstrated with Salt Creek, we will continue to act decisively to strengthen and grow our self-mining business.”

“It still hasn’t recovered from that sharp pullback,” Teddy Fusaro, president of Bitwise, told Fortune.

Over the weekend, the price of Bitcoin fell over 10%, from around $70,000 to $62,000, where it has since remained, while some altcoins sank over 15%. Similar to U.S. equities across the board, when reports of the attack first broke, short-term traders who view Bitcoin as a riskier asset—some of whom were leveraged 50x or more and could no longer cover their positions—were forced to liquidate. Crypto markets rebounded slightly on news that Israel and its allies shot down nearly every Iranian missile and drone but have since retreated.

“It was the only asset in financial markets that was tradable at that time, which is one of Bitcoin’s unique strengths,” Fusaro added, “but also makes it susceptible to swings in price over the weekend when it is the only venue for transferring risk during that time.”

🔵 Bitcoin dips amid political tension in the Middle East



📉 On April 13, following Iran's attack on Israel, the price of Bitcoin dropped from around $67,000 to $61,625, resulting in a loss of over $130 million in market cap within minutes.



🌍ETH also suffered, falling by 9.81%… pic.twitter.com/jlTIoJj214 — Crypto Mission (@CryptoMissionPL) April 15, 2024

“Traders reduced exposure and market makers pulled liquidity amidst the peak uncertainty, causing a massive shakeout in the crypto market,” Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, told Fortune.

On Sunday, Peter Schiff, chief economist at Euro Pacific Asset Management and a renowned crypto skeptic, predicted that if Bitcoin fell below $60,000—what he considers a “critical support” point—that could trigger a plummet to $20,000. He warned in an X post that Microstrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, could potentially lose an estimated $2.7 billion in such a scenario.

While many investors are excited about the halving scheduled for Saturday, historically a bullish event, Bitcoin already has risen from about $44,000 at year-end to a high of almost $74,000 in March, added Fusaro. “So, it makes sense that we’d see some of the length and leverage get cleared out, and the short-term impact of traders reducing on Saturday night was a catalyst.”

So far, it looks like we're following the pattern of choppy price action, prior to a face-melting rally.



Patience is the name of the game. pic.twitter.com/oRnkleAYtS — Jelle (@CryptoJelleNL) April 16, 2024

Lunde said that because the upcoming halving has been so widely documented and anticipated, it makes immediate price swings less likely.

“The compounding effect of reduced issuance takes months to materialize, and we do not expect the halving to lead to any meaningful rally neither prior to, nor directly after, the fact,” he added.

Indeed, before the two previous halvings, in 2016 and 2020, there were major price retracements in the immediate run-up. In 2016, it was close to 40%, and in 2020, it was around 20%."

Article content

Article content The downward trend continues with short interest in crypto-mining stocks piling up and Iran’s attacks against Israel over the last weekend prompting the shift to a risk-off environment for investors. But chief executives of the companies remain bullish, touting low-cost operations, more efficient equipment and growing demand for the asset class can make up for $10 billion in annual revenue losses due to the software update. “Riot is here for the long term,” Jason Les, CEO at Riot Platforms, said in a Bloomberg Television interview on Tuesday. “Our long-term investment thesis on Bitcoin is strong and I think we have the setup for a very positive movement in Bitcoin over the next several months here.” Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process, in which miners use specialized computers to validate transactions on the blockchain and earn a reward in the form of the token. That reward, which comprises the vast majority of mining revenue, is cut in half every four years due to the preprogrammed event called the halving. The upcoming halving, the fourth since 2012 will reduce the amount of Bitcoin reward to 450 tokens in daily production from 900.

Article content Miners are also betting on more demand from the new spot ETFs pushing Bitcoin prices higher to mitigate the negative impact from the halving. The digital asset has been on a tear since traditional asset management firms launched the ETFs in January. Those funds have attracted billions of dollars from a wider range of investors beyond the crypto-native communities. “I think it is very hard to predict Bitcoin prices on any kind of short-term time frame. But over the course of years, I think you have seen a steady course of adoption,” said Tyler Page, CEO at Cipher Mining. “I think in large, sort of longer time frames, we can remain very very bullish on the adoption of the network.” —With assistance from Tim Stenovec.

Bitcoin extended its decline from all-time highs this week, but JPMorgan says the recent sell-off is a good entry point for investors as the market prepares for the halving in the coming days.

The world's largest cryptocurrency pulled back from the all-time high of $73,835.57 reached in March, and was trading around $62,445 on Thursday morning.

The nosedive since the end of last month has slashed the total market cap of the 14 US-listed bitcoin miners tracked by JPMorgan by 28% to $14.2 billion through April 15, JPMorgan said.

""With the bitcoin halving on the horizon, we expect heightened volatility and trading volume in both bitcoin and mining stock,"" JPMorgan's Reginald Smith and Charles Pearce wrote in a note on Tuesday. ""That said, we think recent weakness offers an attractive entry point.""

Before the dip, bitcoin had rallied 43% year-to-date and 130% over the past six months. Smith and Pearce said this means that ""a portion of the typical post-halving rally was pulled forward.""

Meanwhile, a key metric of bitcoin's mining efficiency — the hash rate, which is also positively correlated with the crypto's price — surged 4% to a record high over the past two weeks.

""Mining profitability declined modestly over the first two weeks of April, as network hashrate growth outpaced bitcoin price appreciation,"" the note said.

JPMorgan also said they're particularly bullish on Riot Platforms and Iris Energy, noting appealing relative valuations.

The quadrennial bitcoin halving will take place in the coming days, and will reduce the amount of bitcoin rewarded to miners from 6.25 to 3.125."

Article content “Publicly-listed Bitcoin miners are well positioned to take advantage of the new environment, mainly due to greater access to funding and in particular equity financing,” JPMorgan analysts wrote. “This helps them to scale their operations and invest into more efficient equipment.” Similarly, Deutsche Bank analysts do not expect Bitcoin prices to increase significantly following the halving. Since the Bitcoin algorithm has already anticipated the halving, this event has already been factored in the market, the analysts said. The event reduced the so-called mining reward, which is a fixed amount of Bitcoin released from the network to compensate miners for validating its transactions, by half every four years. The modification is likely became effective late Friday, according to data from crypto-mining analytics website mempool.space. In the past, following a Bitcoin halving, the hashrate — a measure of the total mining capacity of the industry – generally falls as some miners are priced out of the market, ethe Deutsche Bank analysts wrote. “Participating in the process of guessing the hash and adding a block to the blockchain becomes less profitable as the reward to mining decreases.”

Article content After Bitcoin’s first three halvings, the hashrate plummeted by 25%, 11%, and 25%, according to Deutsche Bank. Despite not expecting drastic price fluctuations, Deutsche Bank still expects Bitcoin prices to remain high in the midst of expectations of spot Ethereum ETF approvals, central bank rate cuts and regulatory changes. “Adding to that, a surge in layer-2 solutions and DeFi activity, which augment the network’s practical utility, and the setup begins to look remarkably favorable for the Bitcoin ecosystem and the wider crypto space,” they wrote. Currently, the US accounts for 40% of Bitcoin mining. However, both JPMorgan and Deutsche Bank agree that it is likely that some Bitcoin mining firms would look to diversify into “low energy cost regions” such as Latin America or Africa post-halving to locate their inefficient mining supply and gain salvage values from those rigs which would otherwise sit idle. —With assistance from Isabelle Lee.

The long-awaited bitcoin halving bell is here, but don't bet on more rapid gains just yet — JPMorgan says the price of the world's largest crypto could tumble shortly after the event.

The quadrennial halving — scheduled around April 19-20 — slashes the amount of new bitcoin entering circulation by reducing the amount rewarded to miners by half. The market has widely been anticipating the event as a bullish catalyst, helping to send the token to record highs in 2024.

""We do not expect bitcoin price increases post halving as it has been already priced in. In fact we see downside for the bitcoin price post halving for several reasons."" analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note this week.

First, JPMorgan says that the bitcoin market is still riding high in overbought territory after surging to record highs in March. Panigirtzoglou previously pointed out several indicators that confirm this.

""There remains considerable optimism in the market over the prospect for prices rising significantly by year-end, with a significant component of that optimism arising from a view that bitcoin demand via spot ETFs would continue at the same pace even as the supply of bitcoin diminishes after the halving event,"" he said in a separate note at the end of March.

JPMorgan also observes that venture capital funding remains low despite the recent revival in the crypto market, another headwind for the price.

""We had previously argued that a recovery in crypto VC flows is a necessary condition for a sustained recovery in crypto markets so in our mind the subdued VC flows YTD pose a downside risk,"" the bank said in a note earlier this month.

Mining companies will take a hit after the halving, the analysts said, while some could relocate to improve efficiency as they face the prospect of lower rewards. Others may consolidate and combine with larger publicly listed miners.

""Post halving event, it is also likely that some bitcoin mining firms may look to diversify into low energy cost regions such as Latin America or Africa to deploy their inefficient mining rigs to gain salvage values from those rigs which would otherwise sit idle,"" the analysts wrote."

Article content This change to the rewards was all by design and preordained by the code that runs Bitcoin’s blockchain. The supposed anonymous creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, sought to use the halving mechanism to maintain an eventual hard cap of 21 million Bitcoin in order to keep the original cryptocurrency from being inflationary. As a result of this halving, the fourth since 2012, the daily reward paid to miners will drop to 450 Bitcoin from 900. Bitcoin advocates expect the halving to be a positive catalyst for the latest bull market since it further reduces the supply of new tokens at a time when demand for them has risen from new exchange-traded funds that directly hold the digital asset. Proponents of the original cryptocurrency such as MicroStrategy Inc. Chairman Michael Saylor have touted it is a better store of value than traditional fiat currencies, which they say are more vulnerable to inflation. Still, while Bitcoin has rallied to records following past halvings, market watchers including analysts from JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Deutsche Bank AG had predicted that the event was pretty much priced into the market.

Instead, it has helped him reap a huge windfall from his holdings in the cryptocurrency and in MicroStrategy stock.

So far this year, the billionaire executive chairman of MicroStrategy has made $370 million by selling hundreds of thousands of company shares through a stock-sale plan struck with the company last year, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

But that doesn’t include his massive paper profits. As of Friday, the combination of Saylor’s total MicroStrategy shares (excluding those in the stock-sale plan) and his last revealed count of personal Bitcoin were worth approximately $3.49 billion. Since the start of this year, that’s a gain of about 60%, or upwards of $1 billion. And since the start of 2023—when the crypto sector began rebounding—his shares and Bitcoin holdings have given him approximate paper gains of just under $3 billion.

The value of MicroStrategy’s stock has exploded since January as Bitcoin soared to new highs in part due to the launch of new exchange-traded funds that track the token. MicroStrategy’s shares are up 86% after soaring more than 300% in 2023. Shares closed down 2.8% at about $1,174 on Friday. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is up 46% in 2024 and has leapt nearly 300% since the start of 2023.

Saylor, the once-crypto skeptic turned believer, has made MicroStrategy into a proxy for Bitcoin’s success. Over the past four years, the company bought up billions of dollars worth of the token, sometimes using leverage. While he was CEO in 2020, Microstrategy bought its first Bitcoin tokens—spending $250 million to buy 21,454 at an average price of about $12,000 each.

Four years and multiple purchases later, MicroStrategy owns more than 214,000 Bitcoin, about 1% of all tokens in circulation. At Saturday's price of about $64,000 per Bitcoin, MicroStrategy’s holdings are worth about $13.7 billion. Because Saylor owns about 12% of the company’s shares, his stock holdings plus his personal stash of more than 17,000 Bitcoin factor in majorly to his net worth of just under $4 billion, according to Forbes.

MicroStrategy did not immediately respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

But Saylor hasn’t always been this lucky. After he became a billionaire through MicroStrategy during the dot-com boom, Saylor faced his biggest obstacle. In 2000, MicroStrategy disclosed that its revenue from 1999 was 25% less than it had originally claimed. The accounting scandal cost him $6 billion in one day—the most any single person had ever lost in the span of 24 hours up to then. The SEC accused him of violating federal securities laws later that year, and he settled the charges, paying $8 million to the agency without admitting wrongdoing.

Later, Saylor’s Bitcoin moves were also seen by investors and analysts as crazy. At least one analyst, David Trainer of research firm New Constructs, told Fortune in 2022 that Saylor was “grossly misallocating his investors’ capital,” with his Bitcoin purchases.

“In terms of madmen, Saylor is ‘Elon Junior,’ without the business talent,” Trainer said at the time.

For a while it seemed as if the naysayers were right. After making a killing for MicroStrategy (at least on paper) when Bitcoin hit its previous high point in November 2021, the company’s approach backfired when Bitcoin prices plummeted. MicroStrategy was one of the worst performing large-cap stocks of 2022, largely because of falling Bitcoin prices.

Still, Saylor never wavered in his dedication. Last month, Saylor told CNBC that Bitcoin was “going to eat gold,” replacing it as the most common store of value.

It may still be too soon to tell how MicroStrategy’s plan to be the go-to proxy for Bitcoin will fare, especially after several spot Bitcoin ETFs meant to do the same thing were approved by the SEC in January.

Yet Saylor, with his newly minted millions, isn’t worried in the slightest.

“Is there any company in the world that you wouldn’t like to invest in that could borrow $1 billion at less than 1% interest to invest in your best idea?” he told CNBC."

New York CNN —

The quadrennial “halving” has happened.

The long-awaited halving took place on Friday. While that may sound like some kind of pagan ritual or horror movie title, it’s actually a pretty mechanical operation that’s hardcoded in the design of bitcoin.

Put simply, the halving is an automatic 50% reduction in the number of bitcoin entering circulation. That should, in theory, push the value of the cryptocurrency higher while keeping its inflation in check.

The halving is the World Cup for crypto believers. It happens every four years, and emotions run high.

“Guessing the endgame for Bitcoin after each halving is the ultimate sport,” said Antoni Trenchev, co-founder of crypto lender Nexo, in a statement. “If the previous halvings are anything to go by, it should take no longer than eight months for Bitcoin’s price to double in value.”

That is a decidedly bullish view, but not an uncommon one among the bitcoin faithful.

The price of the cryptocurrency rose to roughly $66,192 on Monday morning, though still far below its all-time highs.

Bitcoin, the world’s first and biggest digital currency, hit a record high of $73,750 in March, fueled partly by investors geeking out over the halving, and partly by the United States’ regulatory approval of several bitcoin-based exchange-traded funds, or ETFs.

Those financial instruments have given mainstream investors an on-ramp to gain exposure to bitcoin’s movements without some of the risks of actually owning the digital currency, and resulted in billions of dollars rushing into bitcoin, which is up 40% this year.

“Every halving has historically resulted in some sort of bullish price action,” said Gareth Rhodes, managing director at research and advisory firm Pacific Street, in an interview earlier this year. “Which makes sense, because you expect with more supply constraints that prices increase.”

In 2020, bitcoin miners’ “reward” went from 12.5 bitcoin to 6.25. Now, it will go from 6.25 down to 3.125. Miners are essentially auditors on the bitcoin blockchain, using powerful supercomputers to validate transactions and getting paid for their work in bitcoin.

Of course, there are plenty of crypto skeptics warning that digital assets have yet to prove their use case in the real world and are, at best, highly risky investments.

“It’s not clear to what degree the past price movements were caused by the halving, versus simply correlated with it,” noted Molly White, a software engineer and prominent crypto critic, in her newsletter Citation Needed. “Notably, the previous halving in May 2020 coincided with massive macroeconomic changes in the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, which brought money flowing into riskier asset classes across the board, and also brought a wave of bored pandemic-driven day traders into crypto.”

Echoing that word of caution, Villanova University finance professor John Sedunov wrote that there’s no guarantee bitcoin’s past performance would repeat itself, “especially in light of the macro environment and potentially rising costs of mining.”

By design, there will never be more than 21 million bitcoin. That creates a scarcity that proponents say creates value. Skeptics tend to argue that such manufactured scarcity doesn’t create any real underlying value. (Perhaps the most prominent in that camp is Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, who has long derided bitcoin as a worthless investment.)

While long-term sentiments on bitcoin are bullish among the crypto faithful, the psychology around an event like the halving is hard to predict and can create volatility that’s extreme even by crypto standards.

Greg Beard, CEO of Stronghold Digital Mining, said in a statement ahead of the halving that while there’s been some exaggerated enthusiasm around the event, the latest bitcoin rallies are “much more than a fad.”

“Bitcoin is maturing with institutional adoption,” Beard said. “It wouldn’t be surprising to see the price of bitcoin increase significantly over the next two years.”"

Bitcoin's price could still more than double this year, thanks to a bullish setup for the crypto coin that could reignite its rally, according to Geoff Kendrick, the head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered.

Speaking to BNN Bloomberg last week, Kendrick reiterated his firm's price target of $150,000, implying a 127% upside for bitcoin by the end of the year.

Bitcoin has pulled back in recent weeks, sliding 11% from its all-time high of around $73,000 in March of this year.

The pullback has been driven by slowing inflows into bitcoin ETFS and rising tensions in the Middle East, which have ""dominated"" crypto markets for now, Kendrick said. But he thinks that could reverse later on in the year, thanks to a huge wave of investor inflows:

Spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds have taken in around $12 billion since they were approved in January, Kendrick estimated. And while crypto traders are feeling temporarily cautious, inflows could pick up to $50 billion to $100 billion over the next two years, he predicted, once the crypto ETF market in the US becomes more ""mature.""

Bitcoin also looks to be on a bullish trajectory after its halving event, Kendrick said. The halving reduces the amount rewarded to bitcoin miners, therefore reducing the amount of new bitcoin entering circulation. That's traditionally led to a spike in bitcoin prices, with the last three halving events followed by fresh all-time highs in the next 12 months.

""From where we are now, it's starting to look like we can push higher again,"" Kendrick said.

Standard Chartered is among the most bullish bitcoin forecasters on Wall Street, and the firm has also predicted bitcoin could climb to $250,000 in 2025, implying a 266% upside from the coin's levels in March."

Historically, halving leads to price surges, but the original cryptocurrency hasn’t yet gained 4% since the event, trading around $66,500 as of early Tuesday afternoon.

✨ Legends celebrating the 1st #Bitcoin halving when the price was $12 in 2012 pic.twitter.com/tkOKCXYDub — Rizzo (@pete_rizzo_) April 18, 2024

There are various reasons for Bitcoin’s price remaining fairly steady so far, and HODLers may have to play the waiting game to reap the rewards, experts told Fortune.

“The halving had no immediate impact on price. The market impact of Friday night’s movement from the fourth to the fifth epoch will be felt over the ensuing weeks and months,” Mark Connors, head of research at 3iQ, told Fortune in a note. He added that the extent to which prices change largely will depend on hashrate (the total computational power being used to mine Bitcoin).

“Friday night,” Connors added, “was more about observing the expected programmatic shift materialize: Did it execute as expected? We now can check that box.”

Bitcoin still ranges. This is the best scenario.



With the halving behind us, the price will eventually break above the current ATH.



That will start a massive new rally. Be patient. #BTC pic.twitter.com/MMg38DRQ5Z — Duo Nine ⚡ YCC (@DU09BTC) April 23, 2024

Bitcoin’s price hasn’t swung massively in either direction is the result of “buy the rumor, sell the news” investors pushing prices down, which may be why Bitcoin dropped 12% in the two weeks before the halving. This retreat was somewhat expected, Vetle Lunde, a senior analyst at K33 Research, previously told Fortune, because the halving had been both widely documented and was anticipated by the Bitcoin algorithm.

The halving affects price due to media attention, historical precedents incentivizing traders, and supply scarcity, Laurence Smith, senior strategist at Consensys, said in a note. But the impact of these factors on markets can be slow, he added. “Media attention draws retail users that are slower to react than professional traders, who conversely, are more likely to be buying the rumor, selling the news, in anticipation of a price spike, which limits the immediate upside,” he said.

Historically, the best day to sell Bitcoin has been 500 days after a halving, Markus Thielen, founder and head of 10x Research, previously told Fortune.

Crypto stock prices

Meanwhile, Bitcoin-related stocks have seen some dramatic gains. MicroStrategy, the largest corporate holder of Bitcoin, was trading near $1,350 midday Tuesday, roughly a 15% bump since Friday. Shares of top U.S. exchange Coinbase were up about 10%, to $235, meanwhile shares of Bitcoin miners have also gained, with Marathon Digital Holdings up 15%, to $9.28, and Riot Platforms up 25%, to $11.70.

The subsequent price increase of the major miners suggests market confidence that they will continue to provide sufficient hashrate to ensure the functionality of the blockchain, despite the reduced rewards, by deploying more efficient hardware to maintain profitability, Matteo Greco, a research analyst at Fineqia International, told Fortune in a note.

However, in the first 48 hours following the halving, the network’s hashrate dropped by around 5%, as miners either went offline or dialed down operations, to avoid losing money.

“A decline in total hashrate post-halving shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign of stress within the mining industry but rather as a typical response to the event. Over time, the hashrate is expected to rebound as miners enhance efficiency and competition intensifies,” Greco said.

As larger miners bought more efficient machines this year, Thomas Chippas, CEO of Argo Blockchain, anticipates that the total hashrate will increase when those computers arrive from manufacturers and are plugged into the network.

“You’ll see more hashrates slowly come back online,” Chippas told Fortune. “The unknown factor, of course, is the rate of change of total hashrate on the network, the difficulty change [of production], and then the price of Bitcoin.”"

The three-nanometer chip could be a major player in the fast-growing mining industry because such chips are a key component in creating some of the most advanced computers.

(Bloomberg) — Digital payments company Block Inc., formerly known as Square, has finished the development of its Bitcoin mining chip as Chief Executive Jack Dorsey continues to advocate for a more accessible and decentralized system — an effort he’s championed since 2021.

Article content

The chip, which powers specialized computers to mine Bitcoin, has been a bottleneck for any newcomers to compete with the incumbent as the development process can be time-consuming and laden with hefty overhead costs. Only a handful of chip manufacturers based in Asia have seen significant profits amid the crypto boom, with Beijing-based Bitmain dominating the market, earning billions of dollars. Chipmaking giant Intel ended its Bitcoin mining series amid a crypto market rout in early 2023.

“This marks an important milestone in our Bitcoin mining project,” the San Francisco-based company said in a statement Tuesday. “Additionally, with our chip design complete, we are excited to share that we are developing a full bitcoin mining system.” Dorsey first announced Block’s efforts to develop the Bitcoin mining system in 2021, along with the introduction of a hardware wallet for the cryptocurrency.

The company is “in the process of completing a full tapeout of the design with a leading global semiconductor foundry,” according to the statement.

Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process in which miners use the machines, or rigs, to validate transaction data on the blockchain and earn a reward in the form of the token. Miners are coping with a heavy blow from the halving, a Bitcoin code update that drastically reduces their main revenue. More efficient machines can help them save power costs and make up some of the margins lost to the halving event which took place last week.

“Our mining chip will utilize the most advanced semiconductor process currently available and will deliver the performance required for mining operators of all types to survive and thrive in the fifth mining epoch (the period following the recent 4th halving of the block subsidy) and beyond,” the company said."

His company, Strike, announced on Wednesday that it’s launching its Bitcoin-focused app, which includes buying and selling services along with payment tools, to customers across Europe, excluding the U.K.

In an interview with Fortune, the 30-year-old Mallers said he views Europe as Strike’s second-biggest market after the U.S. With the price of Bitcoin skyrocketing over the past few months, Strike will be entering a competitive landscape that includes Coinbase, eToro, and BitPanda. Robinhood also announced it would expand its crypto services to Europe in December.

“We don’t view Europe as that crowded—at least compared to America,” Mallers told Fortune. “We think Bitcoin is the biggest innovation of our lifetimes, and we want to be one of the best in the world at it.”

Bitcoin’s climb

Founded in 2019, Strike has taken a Bitcoin-first approach to crypto services as competitors such as Coinbase and Kraken offer a variety of cryptocurrencies, from Ether to Dogecoin.

Strike has experimented with payment services, including implementing compatibility with the Lightning network, a layer 2 protocol that enables faster and cheaper transactions, as well as partnering with Twitter on a tipping feature.

Since raising $80 million in September 2022, just two months before the collapse of FTX sent crypto markets reeling, Strike has continued its expansion of payment tools. In late 2022, the company introduced a feature called Send Globally that allows users to transfer money between different currencies using Bitcoin as an intermediary. It also moved its global headquarters to El Salvador, whose president, Nayib Bukele, has embraced Bitcoin as he faces accusations of authoritarian behavior.

Amid anticipation of the approval of ETFs, Bitcoin erupted out of its sluggish rut in late 2023. After the official announcement came in January, the cryptocurrency climbed in price to an all-time high of over $70,000 in March and has remained above $60,000.

Mallers said that despite Strike’s focus on payment tools, demand from customers has predominantly been for trading and custody services. Strike moved its custody operation in-house in June after the bankruptcy of its former custodian, Prime Trust.

He expects Bitcoin to continue its upward trajectory, especially amid inflation concerns. “Rates over 5% and gold hitting all-time highs tells you everything you need to know about how the market and the world is feeling in regard to confidence and the deficits that they’re seeing,” Mallers said.

Europe expansion

By expanding Strike to Europe, Mallers is betting that consumers will value his platform’s Bitcoin strategy over competitors that may be distracted by other sectors of crypto. (A spokesperson declined to share how many countries the app will be available in.)

“We see a world where everyone ends up wanting a high-quality Bitcoin experience and not that diluted crypto experience,” Mallers told Fortune. “As cycles go through and things like FTX and Binance happen, a lot of people lose confidence in things like Dogecoin because, in my opinion, you should have never had that confidence in the first place.”

He said Strike’s emphasis on Bitcoin has led to lower processing fees for buying and selling the asset than other platforms like Coinbase. He added that in early trials in Europe, Strike also will facilitate lower-cost U.S. dollar-to-euro conversions through Bitcoin than more traditional transfer platforms like Wise.

While Strike offers the leading stablecoin, Tether, to users in Latin America and Africa, Mallers said the app will not include the stablecoin in its European launch due to lower demand. Echoing a recent interview by Tether CEO Paolo Ardoino, he said that there’s no appetite in the U.S. or Europe, where consumers aren’t looking to hedge against the volatility of their native currency.

The Europe expansion represents an ambitious next stage for the company, which has around 70 full-time employees. Mallers said Strike is growing 100% month over month and is profitable, with the firm sweeping a portion of its profits into Bitcoin through its own treasury.

“We’re focused on owning as much Bitcoin as we possibly can,” Mallers told Fortune. It’s an ethos he follows in his personal life as well. In a post on X earlier this year, the founder proclaimed that he no longer owns any U.S. dollars."

"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",Jeff John Roberts,Old Bitcoin wallets keep waking up: How many of the 1.8 million ‘lost’ coins are really gone?,A new survey by Chainalysis and Fortune takes a closer look at dormant wallets from the early Bitcoin era that hold over $1.2 billion.,https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/04/24/bitcoin-wallets-waking-up-lost-coins-satoshi/,"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/lost_wallets_03-01.png?resize=1200,600",2024-04-24 13:16:42+00:00,"On April 15, a long-dormant Bitcoin wallet stirred to life for the first time in nearly 14 years. The wallet owner sent $50 million in Bitcoin to Coinbase, notching a profit of over $3 million on coins that used to be worth less than a penny each. The transaction was unusual but hardly unique. Nearly every week, a wallet from Bitcoin’s early days “wakes up,” raising the question of how many more coins presumed lost could return to circulation. Now, a new survey from Fortune and Chainalysis provides some insight.

As the chart above reveals, hundreds of thousands of “lost” Bitcoins—defined by Chainalysis as those that haven’t stirred since 2014—have moved wallets in the last few years. The chart depicts the net change in the total amount of Bitcoins held in wallets of four different sizes, including those holding fewer than 50 and those with 1,000 or more. Unsurprisingly, the “fewer than 50” category accounts for the vast majority of old Bitcoin wallets as the graphic below shows.

Both graphics show a disproportionate number of old wallets that contain exactly 50 Bitcoins. This reflects the fact that in the currency’s early days, the block reward—the prize awarded to miners who added a block to the blockchain—was 50. (Since then, a series of “halving” events have resulted in the reward being cut to 25, 12.5, 6.25, and just last week to 3.25 Bitcoins.)

Now that the number of Bitcoins mined each day is less than 10% of what it once was, the wallets from long ago—many of them holding sizable fortunes—may attract greater interest.

$121 billion

Those who take only a casual interest in crypto may be surprised to learn there are around 1.75 million Bitcoin wallets, many of which contain significant amounts of money, that have been totally inactive for a decade or more. As of mid-March, these wallets (which don’t include the 30,000 or so wallets associated with Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto) contained 1,798,681 Bitcoins that are today worth around $121 billion.

These 1.8 million “lost” coins account for around 8.5% of the total supply of 21 million—93% of which have already been mined—that will ever exist.

In most cases, it’s impossible to know for sure what became of a given wallet, but it’s a safe bet many are indeed gone forever. In Bitcoin’s early days, the currency was all but worthless—it only crossed the $1 mark in 2011—so many people who received it may have forgotten about it entirely or not bothered to safeguard the private keys needed to open a wallet. Misplaced keys would have been especially common in the pre-2012 era when companies like Coinbase, which hold private keys on users’ behalf, did not exist.

But not all of the dormant wallets are lost or abandoned. Bitcoin is famous for its large collection of “HODLers” who vow to never sell their supply (or to at least hold on to it for a very long time). It is these people—those with “diamond hands,” in crypto parlance—who are responsible for the small number of wallets that have become active since 2018.

So why are they selling? An analysis of newly active wallets by Chainalysis found that, on seven occasions, there was a statistically significant correlation between Bitcoin price changes and wallet activity in a given week. Most times, however, an uptick in wallet activity did not appear to correlate with an obvious external event.

Overall, the pace of old wallets waking has been fairly predictable. The week of March 25, for example, showed a typical pattern where 172 long-dormant wallets became active—169 of which contained fewer than 50 Bitcoins, and one of which had over 1,000. Many Bitcoin owners own more than one wallet, especially those who came to the scene before 2014, so the number of people who activated wallets that week is likely far below 172.

The Satoshi wild card

The Chainalysis survey data suggests that old wallets will continue to wake up at a steady but slowing pace until the number of lost Bitcoins becomes more or less fixed—perhaps around 1.5 million.

One can imagine, though, a future scenario where the rate of wallets waking up accelerates. Namely, that might occur when pre-2014 HODLers grow old and bequeath long-held Bitcoin to their children, who in turn sell them. Such an event, however, would still be decades away since most early Bitcoiners were in their twenties or thirties.

Finally, as noted above, the “lost” Bitcoin figures exclude the wallets controlled by Satoshi, who owns around 1.1 million Bitcoins by Chainalysis’s estimates. A recent Fortune report on Satoshi’s fortune—worth around $75 billion—found that most longtime crypto watchers believe the Bitcoin creator faded into myth long ago, and that it’s extremely unlikely they will ever touch their wallets again.

If this is the case, the total number of missing Bitcoins is currently around 2.9 million—nearly 14% of the total supply. In the long term, the best guess is these Bitcoins will become the digital version of lost treasure that is never found."
