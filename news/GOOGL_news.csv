These injuries are common, and something that physical therapist Stephanie Ridgway, from Birmingham, Alabama, sees often—which is why she took to Instagram to share a simple exercise to ease shoulder pain and help build up strength and stability. As for the best part? All you need is a ball, and to know your ABCs.

The exercise, which Ridgway says, ""looks simple but it's actually a lot harder than it looks,"" uses a ball held to a wall with a straight arm, writing the letters of the alphabet with your hand to improve rotator cuff strength.

Speaking to Newsweek¸ Ridgway explained that: ""The exercise works on shoulder stability and rotator cuff strength by helping to activate and strengthen the small muscles around the shoulder joint to build stability in the shoulder.""

For those who want to try the exercise out, but don't have the mobility to kneel on the ground, Ridgway says that it can done from a standing position and recommends doing the exercise almost daily.

""This exercise can be done five to six times per week,"" she says. ""Stand or kneel with your arm straight in front of you, pushing a small ball into the wall, and write the alphabet with your hand on the ball, and repeat the alphabet two to three times.""

Giving some insight into why the exercise works, the physical therapist added, ""It helps to activate and strengthen the small muscles around the shoulder joint to build stability in the shoulder.

""There are a lot of other exercises that can be helpful for shoulder pain—standing weighted shoulder scaption (scapular plane elevation) and abduction, prone shoulder rows, banded horizontal abduction, and banded bilateral external rotation.""

What Do the Comments Say?

The tip proved hugely popular, with the post having been liked more 167,000 times since being posted. Viewers were keen to put the exercise to the test, with one commenting: ""Oh my gosh, this is so smart. By writing the alphabet, I won't be counting reps, and it will be over before I know it. You have some of the greatest ideas""

Another said: ""Ooo. That's a good idea. It's a good one for ankle rehab too. Caps and lower case. Different shapes, different challenges!""

A third added: ""I've had almost constant shoulder pain that I've been trying to get rid of for the last few years now. I'll definitely give this a try.""

Others, who had already tried the exercise, shared their own experiences, as one said: ""This is a great exercise. I was diagnosed with shoulder impingement a few years ago and my physical therapist had me doing this exercise with others and I no longer have shoulder pain.""

Another shared: ""It felt silly at first, but the results are speaking for themselves. I've been doing this, physiotherapist recommended, since November. My right shoulder hasn't felt this good in around five years."""

Article content But Native youth are particularly vulnerable to these companies’ addictive “profit-driven design choices,” given historic teen suicide rates and mental health issues across Indian Country, chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street of the Spirit Lake Tribe in North Dakota said in a press release. “Enough is enough. Endless scrolling is rewiring our teenagers’ brains,” added Gena Kakkak, chairwoman of the Menominee Indian Tribe of Wisconsin. “We are demanding these social media corporations take responsibility for intentionally creating dangerous features that ramp up the compulsive use of social media by the youth on our Reservation.” Social media companies accused of ‘deliberate misconduct’ Their lawsuit describes “a sophisticated and intentional effort that has caused a continuing, substantial, and longterm burden to the Tribe and its members,” leaving scarce resources for education, cultural preservation and other social programs. A growing number of similar lawsuits are being pursued by USschool districts, states, cities and other entities, claiming that TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube exploit children and adolescents with features that keep them constantly scrolling and checking their accounts.

Article content New York City, its schools and public hospital system accuse the platforms of fueling a childhood mental health crisis that’s disrupting learning and draining resources. School boards in Ontario, Canada, claim teachers are struggling because platforms designed for compulsive use “have rewired the way children think, behave, and learn.” The Associated Press reached out to the companies for comment. Google said “the allegations in these complaints are simply not true.” “Providing young people with a safer, healthier experience has always been core to our work,” Google spokesperson Jose Castaneda said in a statement. “In collaboration with youth, mental health and parenting experts, we built services and policies to provide young people with age-appropriate experiences, and parents with robust controls.” Snap Inc. said it provides an alternative to a feed of online content. “We will always have more work to do, and will continue to work to make Snapchat a platform that helps close friends feel connected, happy and prepared as they face the many challenges of adolescence,” the company’s statement said.

Article content Native children are uniquely stressed out Native Americans experience higher rates of suicide than any other racial demographic in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, jumping nearly 20% from 2015 to 2020 compared with a less-than 1% increase among the overall U.S. population. Mental health care is already difficult to access from remote locations, and generations of colonization and social stigma create more barriers, particularly when the care isn’t culturally appropriate, advocates say. About 87% of people who identify as Native American don’t live on an Indian reservation, according to the 2020 U.S. Census, and social media can help them connect with tradition, culture and other tribal communities. But “they also might experience discrimination online. And social media companies don’t always have great, helpful policies for managing that,” said Andrea Wiglesworth, an enrolled member of the Seneca-Cayuga Nation and Shawnee Tribe who researches stress in Native populations at the University of Minnesota. Native American identity is a complex mix of political and cultural experiences that varies from tribe to tribe and within Indigenous communities, adding a unique layer of stress onto other social pressures, Wiglesworth said.

Article content “I won’t speak for all Native people, but from my lived experience there is this sense of shared responsibility for the well-being of our community and community members,” she added. She said Indigenous people need to think about how they carry that commitment into the digital world. The teenage brain is wired for compulsive responses The science is still emerging about how social media affects teenagers’ mental health. Psychologists and neuroscientists note the potential for both positive and negative side effects, and researchers have yet to draw a direct link between screen time alone and poor mental health outcomes, according to Mitch Prinstein, chief science officer at the American Psychological Association. What researchers do know is that as an adolescent’s brain develops, it builds and strengthens the connections that guide responses for a variety of human interactions while it creates more receptors for oxytocin and dopamine. This is the brain’s reward system, Prinstein said, and it manifests in adolescents a need for both positive feedback and concern about social punishments.

Article content “In the 1980s that meant that we were suddenly talking about who’s in which clique and who sits at which lunch table and are you wearing the right clothes to get positive feedback when you go to school. In 2024, we’re now making it possible to kind of feed that with 24/7, 365 button-pressing for feedback and input from peers,” he said. Prinstein called for new legislation in Senate testimony last year, saying federal regulators should have more power to prohibit exploitative business practices and require social media companies to protect the well-being of children on their platforms. Regulatory efforts focus on TikTok A nationwide investigation by a bipartisan coalition of attorneys general is focusing on whether TikTok is harming the mental health of children and young adults by promoting content and boosting engagement. Meanwhile, some Republican-led states have pursued their own lawsuits. Utah accused TikTok in October of baiting children into excessive social media use. Indiana’s lawsuit accusing TikTok of deceiving users about inappropriate content and insecure personal information was dismissed in November. Arkansas has two lawsuits pending, against TikTok and ByteDance. And in Congress, a bipartisan group of senators is supporting the Kids Online Safety Act, which in part would require platform design changes to prevent harm. Tech industry groups have opposed the bill, and the American Civil Liberties Union has raised censorship concerns. ____ Graham Lew Brewer, who covers Indigenous Affairs for the AP’s Race and Ethnicity, reported from Oklahoma City.

The company supplies small solar powered water pumps, the cost of which is subsidized by the sale of carbon credits, to small-scale farmers, allowing them to replace diesel-powered pumps in some cases and boost yields in fields that weren’t previously irrigated.

SunCulture operates in Kenya, Uganda and Ivory Coast and has distribution agreements in Ethiopia, Zambia and Togo.

“SunCulture helps farmers grow more food, which is exactly the kind of business that prospers,” Hastings said in comments supplied by the irrigation company.

The startup estimates that of the 700 million Africans living on small-holder farms only 4% have access to irrigation, meaning that they have significantly lower yields and are vulnerable to dry weather.

The company has sold 47,000 units, powered by solar panels that can be mounted on small buildings or shacks and in some cases batteries. They use as little as 310 watts of power, equivalent to that needed for about five standard size incandescent light bulbs.

“We’re the largest small-holder solar irrigation company in Africa. We use financial services and carbon revenues to make the cost of solar irrigation 50% cheaper than diesel and petrol pumps,” said Samir Ibrahim, SunCulture’s chief executive officer. “Irrigation is just like old very unsexy technology but it could increase your yields by up to five times.”"

Article content Using this week’s cloud event to show that its AI model is enterprise-ready despite recent stumbles in its consumer-facing tools, focus is now turning to this month’s earnings and a developer’s conference in May. While Alphabet’s path to AI monetization is still seen as cloudy, the stock’s relatively cheap valuation has kept it attractive to many on Wall Street. “While the headlines haven’t been favorable, Google’s role in generative AI products will present massive growth opportunities for the stock,” said Sylvia Jablonski, chief executive officer at Defiance ETFs. Alphabet is also set to benefit from making its own generative AI tools that can power more precise ads and increase revenues from ad spend, she added. Alphabet’s misfiring Gemini product had been viewed as a major setback for a firm known for its technological prowess, with the company in February pausing an image generation feature that drew criticism over inaccurate historical depictions of race. The company’s cloud computing conference in Las Vegas this week offered investors some reassurance, as the firm showed how Gemini can be used to create advertisements, prevent cybersecurity threats and spin up short videos and podcasts. Google also showed a new chip designed to handle AI workloads.

The bill, known as the California Journalism Preservation Act, “would create a level of business uncertainty that no company could accept,” Zaidi said. “To avoid an outcome where all parties lose and the California news industry is left worse off, we urge lawmakers to take a different approach.”

Zaidi also said the company would halt planned investments in news in the state “until there’s clarity on California’s regulatory environment.”

Governments around the globe have taken steps aimed at compelling tech giants to pay for news. Last year, Alphabet said it would remove links to news from Canadian publishers on Google after Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government passed a law requiring digital platforms to compensate local news outlets. Meta Platforms Inc., meanwhile, has opted to wind down its news feature in Canada, along with the US and Australia.

Buffy Wicks, the California assembly member behind the bill, said in a statement that she would remain in dialogue with Google.

“This is a bill about basic fairness — it’s about ensuring platforms pay for the content they repurpose,” she said. “We are committed to continuing negotiations with Google and all other stakeholders to secure a brighter future for California journalists and ensure that the lights of democracy stay on.”

Winning the AI wars won't come cheap. Just ask Demis Hassabis.

To kick off this year's TED conference, Google's AI boss gave an audience in Vancouver a reality check on Monday by offering his best guess on how much the search giant will spend on developing AI: more than $100 billion.

Hassabis, who leads the famed research lab DeepMind within Google, and is arguably the single most important figure at the center of Alphabet's AI plans, shared the astronomical number in response to a question about what the competition was up to.

According to a report from The Information last month, Microsoft and OpenAI have been drawing up plans to create a $100 billion supercomputer called ""Stargate"" containing ""millions of specialized server chips"" to power the ChatGPT-maker's AI.

Naturally, then, when Hassabis was asked about his rivals' rumored supercomputer and its cost, he was quick to note that Google's spend could top that: ""We don't talk about our specific numbers, but I think we're investing more than that over time.""

Though the generative AI boom has already triggered a huge surge of investment — AI startups alone raised almost $50 billion last year, per Crunchbase data — Hassabis' comments signal that competition to lead the AI sector is going to get a lot more expensive.

Related stories

That's especially the case for companies like Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI, which are all engaged in an intense battle to emerge as the first to claim the development of artificial general intelligence, AI with the capacity to match human reasoning and ingenuity.

Chunky chips

Still, the idea that one company could spend more than $100 billion on a single technology that some think could be overhyped is eye-opening.

It's worth considering where that spending could go. For starters, a big chunk of development cost will be on chips.

They make for one of the most expensive purchases for companies invested in the race to develop smarter AI. Simply put, the more chips you have, the more computing power available to train AI models on greater volumes of data.

Companies working on large language models, like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's GPT-4 Turbo, have depended significantly on chips from third parties like Nvidia. But they're increasingly trying to design their own.

Jensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, which has been a key supplier of chips to AI players. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

The general business of training models is getting more expensive, too.

Stanford University's annual AI index report, published this week, notes that the ""training costs of state-of-the-art AI models have reached unprecedented levels.""

It noted that OpenAI's GPT-4 used ""an estimated $78 million worth of compute to train,"" versus the $4.3 million that was used to train GPT-3 in 2020. Google's Gemini Ultra, meanwhile, cost $191 million to train. The original technology behind AI models cost about $900 to train in 2017.

The report also noted that ""there is a direct correlation between the training costs of AI models and their computational requirements,"" so if AGI is the end goal, the cost is only likely to spiral."
