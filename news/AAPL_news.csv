The company willfully and ruthlessly brought the lawsuit on itself by running what is effectively an app store monopoly, one led by a CEO whose unilateral power to ban anyone, anytime, for anything rivals any dictatorship in its sheer capriciousness.

The list of Apple's anti-competitive practices is long. Killing software marketplace competition and forcing 30 percent credit card commissions. Funky rules like ""if you mention you can get a better price on the web we will ban your app."" Prohibiting alternative app stores. Blocking interoperability with other platforms. Favoring its own hardware over competitors'. Creating its own pre-loaded apps that compete with private developers who spent years working on their products.

And it's not just the way Apple deals with other businesses—it's the way it deals with consumers too. It can brick your phone, delete any app at any time, track you and your habits, and censor what you install. You have no say in the matter. Do you really even own your phone? Or did you just pay Apple $1,000 for the privilege of being allowed to use it?

It was all anticompetitive all along, and yet Apple has gotten away with it because many weren't savvy enough to understand what the Silicon Valley giant was up to—and the company lobbied heavily to keep it that way.

This is a fight that's going to last for years. It's going to be ugly, but in the end the government absolutely has to ensure that if it wins, Apple can't engage in malicious compliance to satisfy a court's order.

What do I mean by ""malicious compliance?"" Well, look what happened when a judge ordered the company to accept alternative payment methods in its app store. After the Supreme Court wouldn't take the case, Apple said, ""ok fine, but you have to get our permission to take alternative payments, and you have to keep offering our payment system too, and you have to pay a 27 percent commission on sales.""

That's not ""open up your platform,"" that's ""we have lots of lawyers.""

It's not just in the U.S. either—just look at what the company did in the EU when it was forced to comply with ""digital gatekeeper"" rules. Apple ""opened"" its platform to alternative app stores and payment methods, but only if large developers complied with a new fee.

I, of course, have some skin in the anti-Apple game. In 2021 I was CEO of a company that had the fastest-growing app in Apple's store. And then, just like that, we were gone. Deplatformed, off the iPhone, not accessible, after being given an arbitrary demand and 24 hours to comply.

Imagine having 15 million users disappear with the click of a button on one day's notice because public media perception changes.

And while I understand that the circumstances around our app—Parler—were highly unique, and I'm not excusing anyone's misbehavior by any means, the fact remains that Apple wields almost unprecedented power to destroy companies at any time, for any reason, with little to no warning.

This is one case where, even as a fan of limited government and free enterprise, I absolutely hope the Justice Department prosecutes vigorously. Apple needs to be held accountable. The iPhone needs alternative app stores, sideloading (like Android), multiple payment options, interface parity for third-party hardware, and frankly any other change the government can think of to bust up the monopoly.

No one company should have that much power over other private enterprises. To the extent we even have antitrust laws, this is why they exist.

A former Apple employee said the iPhone maker's battle with the DOJ over anti-trust accusations threatens its core identity.

""This is a battle for the soul of Apple,"" Michael Gartenberg, once the senior director of the tech giant's worldwide product marketing team, told the Wall Street Journal. ""Governments around the world are trying to take apart Apple's DNA strand by strand.""

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Gartenberg's comments come after the US Department of Justice sued Apple, accusing it of engaging in anti-competitive practices to crowd out the smartphone market.

The DOJ pointed to everything from janky iPhone-Android messaging to limited third-party smartwatch compatibility with the iPhone as evidence for the company's alleged misconduct. It's the latest addition to Apple's woes following a nearly $2 billion fine from the EU over its App Store policies and declining iPhone sales in China.

In a statement to Business Insider, Gartenberg said that Apple has always tried to present itself as a company that prioritizes customers, whereas the DOJ sees the company as putting shareholders first.

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider before publication.

Before leaving the company, Gartenberg, according to the WSJ, worked under Phil Schiller — the ex-senior vice president of the worldwide marketing team who appears to have played a key role in defending Apple's perceived anti-competitive tactics.

In 2016, Schiller forwarded an email to CEO Tim Cook that ""moving iMessage to Android will hurt us more than help us."" The DOJ cited the exchange in its suit as evidence of illegal behavior.

Since stepping down from his executive role in 2020, Schiller, now an ""Apple Fellow"" who oversees the App Store, appears to keep defending Apple's business practices.

In 2021, Schiller was a key witness in Epic Games' antitrust lawsuit against Apple. The gaming company sued the iPhone maker, claiming it engaged in anticompetitive behavior and illegally maintained a monopoly through its App Store practices. For example, Apple barred games like Fortnite from being sold in third-party app marketplaces. In court, Schiller argued that barring apps from being available from outside marketplaces was primarily a security concern.

In late January, however, the company was forced to allow people access to rival app stores on the iPhone in Europe to comply with the Digital Markets Act, known as DMA.

In response, Schiller said in February that he still believes Apple needs to do whatever it takes to keep its products safe.

""I have no qualms in saying that our goal is going to always be to make the App Store the safest, best place for users to get apps,"" Schiller told Fast Company in February.

""I think users— and the whole developer ecosystem—have benefited from that work that we've done together with them,"" he added. ""And we're going to keep doing that."""

There's a new phishing scheme targeting Apple owners, and it's pretty elaborate — and annoying.

Some iPhone owners have received unprompted and repeated notifications to allow a reset of their Apple ID password, a form of attack known as ""MFA bombing,"" according to a report from cybersecurity research and news website Krebs on Security.

Since the notifications come from the Apple device, users can't use their phone until they deny or accept the request to reset.

One user, Parth Patel, posted on X, formerly Twitter, that he received over 100 notifications asking him to reset his password. Patel told Business Insider that he's a cofounder of an AI startup still in stealth.

The attackers made a led high effort focused attack on me, using OSINT data from People Data Labs and caller ID spoofing.



First, around 6:36pm yesterday all of my Apple devices started blowing up with Reset Password notifications.



Because these are Apple system level alerts,… pic.twitter.com/vX1AZvoVoN — Parth (@parth220_) March 23, 2024

The scammer's attempts to gain access to his Apple account didn't end there.

Patel said after 15 minutes of alerts, he received a spoofed call from the Apple Support phone number, telling him again that he needed to reset his password.

Related stories

""I was obviously still on guard, so I asked them to validate a ton of information about me, before answering any of their questions,"" Patel said. ""They got a lot right, from DOB, to email, to phone number, to current address, historic addresses….""

Patel said in his social media post that the only detail they got wrong was his name — which confirmed for him that it was a scam.

Patel told BI that the goal of the scam was likely to get the user to reset their Apple ID password using a one-time code sent over text message. If the user used the one-time code, the attackers could reset the password on the account, lock the user out, and even wipe all their Apple devices.

Another iPhone owner quoted in Krebs on Security said he experienced a similar situation and ended up replacing his phone and making a new Apple account after the phishing attempt, but still received the password-reset requests — leading him to believe the scammer was relying on knowing his phone number to carry out the scheme.

Apple said it has taken steps to address the reported issue.

""We are aware of reports that a small number of iPhone users are receiving a high volume of alerts asking if they are attempting to reset their password,"" an Apple spokesperson told Business Insider.

Apple said scammers often used spoofed calls to claim suspicious activity on an account or device. They aim to get information, money, or even Apple gift cards.

A good rule of thumb is that if you didn't personally try to reset your Apple password, you shouldn't be receiving a request to allow your password to reset. Even if the notifications are annoying and frequent — which should be a red flag anyway — resist the urge to tap ""accept"" to be rid of them.

Customers should assume any suspicious message, call, or request for personal information is a scam and hang up, according to Apple. Apple also said that you should call the company directly if you feel suspicious.

US customers can report scam phone calls to the Federal Trade Commission at reportfraud.ftc.gov or to local law enforcement agencies."

Apple is suing a former employee who it said leaked confidential information, including about products he didn't like, from his work-issued iPhone.

In a complaint filed on March 18 at a California court, Apple said former software engineer Andrew Aude shared information about projects, including Apple's Journal app and the Vision Pro, to media outlets and employees at other tech companies over a period of five years.

The tech giant is suing Aude, who was hired in 2016, for breaching its confidentiality agreement and violating labor laws.

The lawsuit was first reported by MacRumors.

Apple said it discovered the leaks in late 2023. When confronted, it said Aude denied his involvement but then feigned a bathroom break and ""permanently deleted significant amounts of evidence from his device.""

This included deleting the Signal app — which he used for communications — from his work-issued phone, it said.

But the lawsuit said that Aude often saved screenshots of his communications on his work iPhone ""to preserve them for posterity,"" and Apple was able to retrieve those.

Related stories

According to Apple's lawsuit, an analysis of Aude's Apple-issued work iPhone showed he had over 1,400 encrypted communications with one Wall Street Journal journalist over a four-month period.

Advertisement

Aude also sent a journalist at The Information over 10,000 text messages, and traveled to meet her, according to Apple.

Aude's screenshots were attached to the lawsuit. In one particular leak to the Journal journalist around April 2023, Aude's screenshots showed ""'giddy anticipation"" of the ""chaos"" awaiting the company following the publication of leaked information, Apple said.

Aude had also characterized the leak to other colleagues as a ""necessary evil,"" it added.

""In connection with one leak, Mr. Aude admitted that he violated his obligations to Apple so he could 'kill' products and features with which he took issue,"" Apple said separately in the lawsuit.

Advertisement

Aude's leaking of information led to the publication of multiple news reports, according to Apple.

""His disclosures also have impeded Apple's ability to surprise and delight with its new offerings,"" the tech company said in its lawsuit.

While Aude's employment has been terminated, Apple said he poses an ""ongoing threat"" to the company due to his knowledge of its confidential and proprietary information, as well as his ""long and extensive history of disclosing it to third parties intentionally and without authorization.""

Apple is pursuing a jury trial, damages, and an order directing Aude not to disclose the company's confidential and proprietary information to third parties without its consent. It also wants Aude to give up his discretionary bonuses and restricted stock units.

The Department of Justice is suing Apple for monopolizing smartphone markets — and cheekily used a term coined by Warren Buffett to make its case against the investor's No. 1 stock.

Federal regulators used the word ""moat"" eight times in their civil antitrust complain to describe the defenses that Apple sets up to keep competitors at bay.

They alleged the iPhone maker ""built and reinforced"" a ""wide and deep"" moat around its ""smartphone monopoly,"" and said the company ""crushes innovation that might help fill in the moat.""

They also wrote that Apple's ""moat building has not resulted in lower prices, higher output, improved innovation, or a better user experience for smartphone users,"" although some may disagree.

Castles and moats

Buffett popularized the concept of a company having a ""moat"" around it that protects it from rivals.

The Berkshire Hathaway CEO has used the metaphor dozens of times in his yearly shareholder letters, and during his company's annual gatherings.

Here's what Buffett said about two of his favorite businesses, Coke and Gillette, in his 1993 letter:

""The might of their brand names, the attributes of their products, and the strength of their distribution systems give them an enormous competitive advantage, setting up a protective moat around their economic castles. The average company, in contrast, does battle daily without any such means of protection.""

Advertisement

The Berkshire CEO built on the idea in his 2007 letter:

""A truly great business must have an enduring 'moat' that protects excellent returns on invested capital. The dynamics of capitalism guarantee that competitors will repeatedly assault any business 'castle' that is earning high returns.

Therefore a formidable barrier such as a company's being the low-cost producer (GEICO, Costco) or possessing a powerful worldwide brand (Coca-Cola, Gillette, American Express) is essential for sustained success. Business history is filled with 'Roman Candles,' companies whose moats proved illusory and were soon crossed.""

The billionaire deployed the metaphor once again during Berkshire's 2017 meeting:

Advertisement

""If you've got a wonderful business, even if it's a small one like See's Candy, you basically have an economic castle. And in capitalism, people are going to try and take away that castle from you.

Related stories

So, you want a moat around it that can protect it. And then you want a knight in the castle that's pretty darn good at warding off marauders.""

Crocodiles, poison — and sand

Moats have been core to Buffett's investing philosophy for decades. He seeks to invest in businesses with ""unbreachable moats,"" he said in his 1995 letter.

His valuation process includes analyzing a company's moat, as it affects the certainty and size of its future cash flows, he said at the 1999 meeting.

Advertisement

The Berkshire chief also tells the managers of all of the conglomerate's subsidiaries to work relentlessly to widen their moats, he wrote in his 2012 letter.

He even defended moats at the 2018 meeting after Tesla CEO Elon Musk called them ""lame."" His response: ""I don't think he'd want to take us on in candy.""

Buffett is clearly passionate about moats, but he's still had some fun with the metaphor over the years. At the 2000 meeting, he praised See's CEO at the time for throwing ""crocodiles, and sharks, and piranhas in the moat"" as that made it ""harder for people to swim across and attack the castle.""

Moreover, he described Moody's moat as being ""far wider, deeper, and infested with far more poisonous characters.""

Advertisement

Buffett's late business partner, Charlie Munger, also chimed in during the 2009 meeting, bemoaning that ""a lot of moats have been filling up with sand lately.""

Regulators aren't moat fans

Buffett almost certainly evaluated the moat around Apple and the iPhone and liked what he saw, given he put about $36 billion into the tech titan between 2016 and 2018.

Berkshire's position has more than quadrupled in value to more than $150 billion, making Apple the top holding in Buffett's roughly $350 billion stock portfolio — while Berkshire's near-6% stake ranks it among Apple's largest shareholders.

Unsurprisingly, Buffett has loudly praised Apple in recent years. He's called it a ""better business than any we own,"" and hailed CEO Tim Cook as a world-class manager.

Advertisement

He's also underscored how indispensable the iPhone is by suggesting owners would probably turn down a $10,000 offer to never use the device again.

The stickiness of Apple's product ecosystem, and how that staves off competition, may well have been a factor in Buffett's backing and high praise.

Yet regulators are accusing Apple of going too far in digging its moat. They've alleged it illegally excludes and deters competition by stopping its products from working well — or at all — with non-Apple devices and apps. Apple has argued that a so-called walled garden is more secure and allows a more consistent user experience.

While Buffett clearly sees moats as beneficial to a company and its investors, even he might admit they're not always good for consumers or for fostering innovation.

The Department of Justice has added insult to injury by not only targeting Buffett's biggest stock bet, but also wielding the investor's moat metaphor against him, at least indirectly."

Now the question is, will Xiaomi present the same kind of challenge to Tesla as to Apple?

On Thursday, the Chinese juggernaut launched its first electric vehicle, the SU7 sedan. Billionaire founder and CEO Lei Jun—a household name in China—said at the presentation in Beijing, “Many people ask me who the Xiaomi SU7 is built for. My answer is, isn’t it time for Tesla Model 3 users to upgrade?”

The entry of yet another deep-pocketed rival in China comes at a difficult time for Elon Musk’s carmaker. Last week, Bloomberg reported that Tesla had reduced EV production at its Shanghai factory amid intense competition and sluggish growth in China. Tesla’s market cap has fallen about 30% this year, spurring the company to scrap Musk’s no-advertising mantra. Tesla also faces competition from China’s Warren Buffett–backed BYD, which dethroned it a few months ago as the world’s top EV seller.

Of course, Tesla has already proved itself as a leading EV maker, while Xiaomi is new in the space.

“In the three years of developing this car, my biggest realization is that making cars is extremely difficult,” Lei said on Thursday. “Even a giant like Apple gave up on it.”

In February, Lei responded to Apple ending its EV project, saying he was “shocked” by the decision. He’s cited Apple cofounder Steve Jobs as a primary inspiration to become an entrepreneur.

Xiaomi, which also makes smart TVs and home appliances, enjoys Apple-like popularity in China.

Big bet on EVs

Lei claimed on Thursday that the SU7, available only in China to start, beats the Tesla Model 3 on 90% of specifications, with Xiaomi needing a few more years to catch up on the rest. He said the sedan had a minimum driving range of 700 kilometers (nearly 435 miles) versus 606 for the Model 3. The base model will sell for under $30,000, cheaper than the Model 3 in China.

Lei admitted his company will be losing money on every vehicle it sells for the time being. In December, he said that Xiaomi would spend 10 times the labor and investment carmakers usually commit to a new model. But, he added on Thursday, “Xiaomi has enough cash reserves to cope with any fierce competition in the next five years.”

Time will tell if Lei made the right call by entering the EV market or if Xiaomi should have veered away as Apple did. Plenty of EV startups once valued in the billions are now struggling.

“The risk is that they focus too much on the EV space and lose focus on the sectors and products that got them there,” Tu Le, founder of consultancy Sino Auto Insights, told Reuters.

But Xiaomi is off to a strong start, at least, with the company reporting that it had received 120,000 firm orders for the SU7 in 36 hours, meaning this year’s production capacity is sold out."
"{'id': 'newsweek', 'name': 'Newsweek'}",,New York City vs. Cairo—How the Big Apple Could Learn From Cairo's Metro System | Opinion,To call New York City's subway a pioneering wonder would be incorrect.,https://www.newsweek.com/new-york-city-vs-cairohow-big-apple-could-learn-cairos-metro-system-opinion-1885052,https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2370187/train-french-built-line-1.jpg,2024-04-01 11:45:07+00:00,"It's no secret that New York City's subway system has been plagued by safety issues. The increase in subway crimes have led to a decrease in public trust and safety. Recently, New York deployed the National Guard to alleviate the crisis. As someone who resides between New York and Cairo, I find the parallels fascinating between these two cities that never sleep, but the intricate framework behind New York's public transportation is lacking. What can New York City Mayor Eric Adams learn from Cairo's metro system?

For starters, bag-screenings are a routine aspect of Cairo's metro system. Recently, subways incorporated bag checks at stations deemed busy, a measure that fails to address the reality that crimes can occur (or begin) regardless of the terminal's traffic. I remember a subway trip during off-peak hours last summer where the passenger seated beside me had ""forgotten"" to take his knife out of his pocket, which caused the blade to dig into my leg. Today, that same subway station has no bag-checks in sight.

Additional to bag screenings, Cairo utilizes walk-through metal detectors, a swift and reasonable request that hasn't seemed to deter busy riders on their commutes. After all, New York City's subway system served 3.2 million passengers in 2022, less than Cairo's which served 3.5 million passengers.

More than the security measurements, a major difference I found with Egypt's metros was their women's-only compartments. While some visitors have criticized these carts for ""segregation,"" this Western-centric viewpoint ignores that Egypt's women's-only carts—which exist in Mexico, Japan, and India—are not mandatory, but rather establish a space for women's comfortability whether cultural, religious, or as a safety measurement. As a safety-measurement, women's-only compartments only serve as a Band-Aid in a larger global conversation about harassment and other forms of violence against women, but could still be beneficial for an immediate call-to-action by Mayor Adams.

Moreover, the New York subway system's lack of innovation and growth has set itself up to fail. Rather than evolve with the urban landscape, the subway has become a time capsule of a void structure that no longer serves the community. Egypt's metro, the first in Africa and the Middle East, has only continued to grow since its opening in 1987. The development of its new lines have implemented thousands of new jobs, recruiting female drivers to combat the male-dominated culture of transportation. On the other hand, New York subways have failed to grow, increase accessibility during off-peak hours, and even saw staffing issues under former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo's era. Egypt's metro system's success opens a larger conversation about the culture of New York that has allowed this lack of cleanliness and safety to get to what it is today.

While far-right outlets try to vilify New York City as being a Gothom-esque liberal city of law-breaking citizens, it's necessary to reframe the narrative and look at who—or what—creates this environment. While Mayor Adams has a history of blaming others—he recently said that the root issue of the subway crisis lies in ""recidivism""—he fails to acknowledge his own power, or address ways to rectify the subway system. Mayor Adams is only the most recent of a long line of New York mayors and officials who have contributed to an apathetic culture where only the needs of the 1 percent are of concern.

The largest difference I noticed between New York and Cairo's public transportation was the community-oriented mentality found in Cairo: signing new protocols to ensure better access for disabled folks, the common courtesy of offering seats to the elderly, and reframing from smoking among others. The passenger experience is better because Egypt's Ministry of Transportation and officials work to assist the community. The anger subway passengers witness in NYC is a representation of a New York whose officials don't show care in investing in the safety or well-being of its community.

To call New York City's subway a pioneering wonder would be incorrect. The subways have historically always been dark, reflected in fatalities and accidents from poor management in its early years, such as the Malbone Street wreck that led to the loss of 93 lives in 1918. But while NYC's passengers have grown to trust and expect a prompt response to any safety issues when it pertains to mechanics, there is little faith for a solution to the rise in transit crimes.

Rather than try to repeat the same actions, New York City needs to look to other countries that have implemented successful public transportation measures that serves the community. Cairo is just one of many countries that have created capable models for transportation. The National Guard can't save the Big Apple, but a new approach can.

The most blatant contrast I observed between New York City and Cairo—or in a larger cultural context, between the United States and Egypt—is the mythopoetic American arrogance that it's a ""first world country,"" and therefore, has little to learn from a global perspective. What would be innovative is for New York City to acknowledge its shortcomings—from its transit structure to its mental health services—and look to other countries for guidance. Maybe then Mayor Adams' policies can truly be groundbreaking and work to rebuild the city's archaic system far past its sell-by date.

Jon Stewart says Apple once asked him not to have Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan appear on a podcast linked to his Apple TV+ show.

Stewart made the comments during Monday's episode of Comedy Central's ""The Daily Show,"" which featured Khan as a guest. They discussed topics including artificial intelligence and the FTC's antitrust lawsuit against Amazon.

Jon Stewart on “The Daily Show” Monday revealed what led to his abrupt exit from Apple and the cancellation of his short-lived show on its streaming TV platform. Stewart said that the tech giant prohibited him from discussing artificial intelligence or interviewing Federal Trade Commission chair Lina Khan.

Khan was a guest on Stewart’s Comedy Central program, which he returned to in February and hosts on Mondays. Stewart and Khan discussed Big Tech monopolies, after the US Justice Department and more than a dozen states sued Apple last month in a blockbuster antitrust lawsuit that accused Apple of illegally monopolizing the smartphone market.

Stewart said he had his own issues with Apple, telling Khan that he wanted to have her on the TV show’s companion podcast and “Apple asked us not do it.”

“They literally said ‘please don’t talk to her,’” Stewart said. “Having nothing to do with what you do for a living, I don’t think they cared for you.”

Although Khan’s FTC is not involved in the Apple antitrust lawsuit, the regulator has sued a number of tech companies recently, including Amazon.

Stewart also said that Apple wouldn’t let him talk about AI, which he did in the first act of Monday’s show, when he discussed the “false promise” of the budding technology.

“What is that sensitivity? Why are they so afraid to have these conversations out in the public sphere,” he asked Khan. “I think it just shows the dangers of what happens when you concentrate so much power and so much decision making in a small number of companies,” she replied.

Khan also hinted at what tech regulations may be coming down the pike, noting that the FTC and Justice Department are scrutinizing how companies potentially use algorithms for price-fixing. Two weeks ago, the two agencies filed a statement of interest about price fixing in a case against Caesars Entertainment.

“The Problem with Jon Stewart” ran for two seasons from 2021 to 2023 on Apple TV+. He told his show staffers that Apple had concerns about the subject matter he had planned for three shows during the upcoming season, a person familiar with the discussions told CNN in October. Those topics included China, Israel and AI.

Although Apple gave Stewart creative control over the show, he grew increasingly frustrated that the company was pushing back on the show’s guest list and show subjects, he told staff.

Stewart returned to “The Daily Show” earlier this year, marking a welcomed arrival for the show that lost much of its its cultural relevancy when Trevor Noah hosted it. A rotating line-up of comedians who will helm the program the rest of the week, Tuesdays through Thursdays."

“They literally said, ‘Please don’t talk to her,’” Stewart said. “Having nothing to do with what you do for a living, I don’t think they cared for you.”

Additionally, Stewart said Apple refused to let him discuss artificial intelligence on The Problem With Jon Stewart.

Apple did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.

The conversation with Khan came after Stewart talked about AI in the opening moments of the show. Later, he noted to his guest “They wouldn’t let us do even that dumb thing we just did in the first act on AI. Like, what is that sensitivity? Why are they so afraid to even have these conversations out in the public sphere?”

Apple and Jon Stewart’s relationship came to an abrupt end last October. The Problem With Jon Stewart, which was Stewart’s first regular television appearance in six years after his initial 16-year run at his Comedy Central topical comedy show, never shied away from controversial topics, tackling issues including gender identity and gun control, with many episodes going viral. The final season was nominated for an Emmy in the outstanding talk series category.

Apple is facing an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department and 16 states which accuses Apple of monopolizing the smartphone market. Khan’s FTC is not a part of that suit."

A new app store coming to iPhones in the EU provides a glimpse into what changes iPhone users in the US can expect if the Department of Justice wins its antitrust lawsuit against Apple.

AltStore is a third-party app store that seeks to be an alternative to Apple's default. The rival comes after the EU brought in the Digital Markets Act this year, which aims to promote fair competition in the digital marketplace — and which forced Apple to crack open its App Store in January and to allow iPhone owners in the region to use alternative stores.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Users who want to use the AltStore shouldn't expect a massive change, though.

""It all works virtually the same as the App Store now,"" Riley Testut, the developer of AltStore, told TechCrunch regarding his product.

One difference, however, is that AltStore is designed with the goal of creating a marketplace that gives developers control over their apps' deployment. While Apple must approve apps before putting them in its own store, AltStore allows developers to upload their mobile software without review for immediate distribution, according to the company.

Additionally, it appears to cost developers less money. Apple's in-app subscriptions typically come with a 15% to 30% commission fee on sales that goes to the tech giant. AltStore, however, says it doesn't take a cut. Instead, developers can include a custom Patreon integration to market their apps directly to iPhone users. That way, developers can monetize their offerings without ads, paid downloads, and in-app purchases. They'll also be able to use the same Patreon integration to distribute 'paid' apps, Testut told TechCrunch.

Apple still needs to approve the AltStore before it becomes widely available in the EU, Testut told TechCrunch. And once it does, iPhone users in the region will be able to download apps like Delta, a Nintendo game emulator, and Dolphin, a GameCube and Wii emulator, among others, according to the AltStore website.

Delta, a Nintendo emulator, will be available on AltStore once launched. Riley Testut/AltStore

The emergence of the AltStore after the launch of the DMA also hints at what potential US iPhone changes could look like if Apple loses its battle with the DOJ. US regulators are suing the tech giant, accusing it of using anti-competitive practices to dominate the smartphone market.

""I believe there's a strong possibility we'd see entirely new iOS apps appear that can't exist today due to Apple's rules, especially from independent developers,"" Testut, the developer behind AltStore, previously told Business Insider regarding the lawsuit. The DOJ has accused Apple of not permitting cross-platform apps, locking users into the company's ecosystem.

Industry leaders say if Apple lost to the DOJ, it could result in lower prices, cheaper streaming subscription services, more tap-to-pay options, smartwatch options, and an improved Android-iPhone texting experience.

Not everyone believes these iPhone changes would be good for consumers. Apple, which denies the allegations made in the lawsuit, says it would create a less secure user experience.

""This lawsuit threatens who we are and the principles that set Apple products apart in fiercely competitive markets,"" Apple told BI in March. ""If successful, it would hinder our ability to create the kind of technology people expect from Apple—where hardware, software, and services intersect.""

AltStore and Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider before publication. Testut declined to comment."

Apple's new development in AI aims to take on OpenAI's GPT products and may make your interactions with virtual assistants like Siri more intuitive.

The ReaLM system, which stands for ""Reference Resolution As Language Modeling,"" understands ambiguous on-screen images and content and conversational context to enable more natural interactions with AI.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The new Apple system outperforms other large language models like GPT-4 when determining context and what linguistic expressions refer to, according to the researchers who created it. And, as a less complex system than other Large Language Models like OpenAI's GPT series, researchers called ReaLM ""an ideal choice"" for a context-deciphering system ""that can exist on-device without compromising on performance.""

Related stories

For example, let's say you ask Siri to show you a list of local pharmacies. Upon being presented with the list, you might ask it to ""Call the one on Rainbow Road"" or ""Call the bottom one."" With ReaLM, instead of getting an error message asking for more information, Siri could decipher the context needed to follow through with such a task better than GPT-4 can, according to the Apple researchers who created the system.

""Human speech typically contains ambiguous references such as 'they' or 'that,' whose meaning is obvious (to other humans) given the context,"" the researchers wrote about ReaLM's abilities. ""Being able to understand context, including references like these, is essential for a conversational assistant that aims to allow a user to naturally communicate their requirements to an agent, or to have a conversation with it.""

The ReaLM system can interpret images embedded in text, which the researchers say can be used to extract information like phone numbers or recipes from on-page images.

OpenAI's GPT-3.5 accepts only text input, and GPT-4, which can also contextualize images, is a large system trained mostly on natural, real-world images, not screenshots — which the Apple researchers say hinders its practical performance and makes ReaLM the better option for understanding on-screen information.

""Apple has long been seen as a laggard to Microsoft, Google, and Amazon in developing conversational AI,"" The Information reported. ""The iPhone maker has a reputation for being a careful, deliberate developer of new products — a tactic that's worked well to gain the trust of consumers but may come to hurt it in the fast-paced AI race.""

But with the teasing of ReaLM's capabilities, it appears Apple may be getting ready to enter the race in earnest.

The researchers behind ReaLM and representatives for OpenAI did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

It remains unclear when or whether ReaLM will be implemented into Siri or other Apple products, but CEO Tim Cook said during a recent earnings call that the company is ""excited to share details of our ongoing work in AI later this year."""

Half the time, by the time you've figured it out, it's already passé. Or it's an Apple Vision Pro situation, where opinions vary on whether the device makes someone look cool or like a clown. One thing that is definitely not ""cool,"" it seems, is having a green text bubble.

On Apple's iPhones, instead of conversations appearing in the typical gray and blue, text messages from non-Apple phones register as gray and a sort of hot green. Personally, I don't entirely get the fuss over the green-bubble question in text messages, but I know it's A Thing in American culture. A former coworker of mine has a whole rant about how on dating apps women would judge him for having an Android (well, that and living in New Jersey).

Anecdotes aside, this form of supposed cyberdiscrimination has even gotten the attention of the federal government. In its antitrust lawsuit against Apple alleging the tech giant has unfairly cornered the smartphone market, the Justice Department explicitly calls out the green-bubble issue. In the filing, it says people without Apple devices often feel a ""social stigma, exclusion, and blame for 'breaking' chats where other participants own iPhones."" The department claims that's on purpose — it alleges Apple takes all sorts of measures to maintain a monopoly on smartphones and keep developers and consumers within its grip, including making the messaging experience when communicating with non-iPhone users different and weird.

The ultimate reason that Apple causes friction with products it doesn't make is clear: to make money. What drives consumers, however, is worth pausing on. Sure, Apple has positioned the iPhone as the ""cool"" phone, but why do we care? What makes the blue iMessage bubbles the preferable color? Why do so many consumers see their buying habits as a sign of something bigger?

""Consumers really care about using products and brands to express who they are to themselves and the world around them,"" Nailya Ordabayeva, an associate professor of business administration at Dartmouth's Tuck School of Business, said. ""Brands that have a really well-established image, Apple's cool image, for instance, that they worked on to establish over the years — consumers really see that as a legitimate signal of their own coolness to themselves and other people.""

Apple has spent more than 15 years fostering an in-crowd/out-crowd scenario with the iPhone. The Cupertino, California, company has long cast itself as hyperinnovative and alluring, and the iPhone is the pinnacle of those efforts. Steve Jobs called the device a ""revolutionary and magical"" product when he introduced it in 2007, setting the tone for an aura that has persisted even as many other trendy products have cycled through. The iPhone keeps with Apple's minimalistic, sleek design philosophy and stays within a production process the company has tight control over. An Android device can look like anything and be from anyone — Samsung, Google, Motorola. There's only one iPhone, and there's no real cheaper version of it, either.

Consumers really care about using products and brands to express who they are to themselves and the world around them.

Apple reinforces the design allure of the iPhone by generating excitement every time a new product comes out. Every announcement of a new iteration, no matter how small the changes are, is treated like a holy event. The image of people lined up outside the Apple Store on the day of an iPhone launch is implanted in our collective imagination. Apple won't let bad guys in movies have iPhones, lest anyone get the wrong idea. And if you've ever watched ""Ted Lasso"" or anything else on Apple TV+, you've perhaps noticed iPhones and Apple products are ubiquitous.

By elevating the iPhone to the status of a prestige item, like a Louis Vuitton bag or a Mercedes car, Apple can play on consumers' desire to ""keep up with the Joneses,"" to try to emulate those around them and not be left behind. People have a tendency toward conformity; we want to feel like we belong. That's especially pertinent for teens and young adults. They don't want to appear out of the loop or of lower status, like their families can't afford a higher-priced item.

""They're at a stage where they're trying to formulate their identity, and when you're trying to formulate your identity, you also figure out which social groups do you belong to, in which are you an insider and which are you an outsider,"" Joseph Nunes, a marketing professor at the USC Marshall School of Business, said. ""And we all know that in the teenage years, being an insider, being left out, this really matters even more.""

Apple has long used marketing tricks, like endless lines outside its stores, to cultivate a prestige image. NurPhoto / Getty Images

This drive doesn't end in adulthood; it just shifts. Maybe a 30-something doesn't care about which phone they have (though many still do), but they do care about which car they drive and where their kids go to school. And they're probably still holding on to their iPhones, however they do or don't think it makes them look, because they're used to them. They're already in too deep, and the switching cost feels too high — especially if all their other devices are Apple.

Humans are a hierarchical species. We look down to feel better about ourselves and look up to gauge where we stand on the scale. People seek ways to signal status in that social comparison setting, and having a supposedly attractive or special thing is a way to accomplish that. It's a form of ""conspicuous consumption,"" a way to display your standing and wealth.

""Consumers who seek approval of others or are motivated by social dominance engage in conspicuous consumption to showcase their elitism to others,"" Joshua Clarkson, a consumer psychologist and marketing professor at the University of Cincinnati, told me in an email. ""You could imagine both of these groups of consumers being heavily vested in iMessage (i.e., to not be the person with the Android on the group chat) as either a way to fit in (if seeking others' approval) or a way to exclude others (if driven by social dominance).""

Consumers who seek approval of others or are motivated by social dominance engage in conspicuous consumption to showcase their elitism to others.

Some brands are good at playing into these predispositions. Luxury and prestige companies say their products are of higher quality, which is often true. But the functional attributes are reinforced by aspirational positioning — you can't just make something of a higher quality; you have to make people think it's worth more. That positioning allows companies to price their premium-perceived products accordingly. They advertise them with influencers and celebrities who align with their image. They often inject a sense of scarcity and urgency into the mix. While iPhones are ubiquitous, the latest versions, which also come with a new price point, are not.

The societal context matters here, too, Nunes said: ""We're in a period of society today that's got great inequality. And then that sort of reinforces this notion that there are the haves and the have-nots.""

There's nothing wrong with wanting an iPhone. In a world where some people are constantly seeking out prestige and status through their consumption, it would be stranger if there weren't some drive to have whichever phone is perceived as the best. And consumers are clearly picking up what Apple is putting down — at a nearly $3 trillion market cap, it's one of the most valuable companies in the world. But it's important to remember that having whatever the fancy thing is, ultimately, doesn't make us happier. Sometimes, it even makes us more judgmental, hence the whole green-bubble bias.

We see the things we have as an extension of ourselves, perhaps especially our phones — it's where many people live a lot of their lives. iPhone bias probably isn't going anywhere, even if we're unaware of it.

""Brands are more than just the functional products that they offer, that they are this symbol of who consumers want to see themselves as and who they want to be,"" Ordabayeva said. Apparently, a lot of us want to see ourselves as iPhone users and all that comes with it. I switched from a Samsung to an iPhone in 2014. It just seemed like the thing to do, which is what Apple is banking on.

The streaming giant will increase prices by about $1 to $2 a month in five markets by the end of April, including the UK, Australia and Pakistan, according to people familiar with the matter. It will raise prices in the US, its largest territory, later this year, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing confidential plans.

Spotify shares jumped 4.6% to $281.92 at 9:35 a.m. in New York.

The higher prices will help cover the cost of audiobooks, a popular service introduced late last year. Spotify offers customers up to 15 hours of audiobook listening a month as part of their paid plan. While the company pays publishers for books, it has so far only collected additional revenue from listeners who exceed the limit.

The Swedish audio company is also going to introduce a new basic tier that will offer music and podcasts — but not audiobooks — for the current $11 monthly price of an individual premium plan, said the people. Users of that plan will need to pay for audiobooks.

The new basic tier is the first of what will be several new pricing options from Spotify. The company has also been working on a “supremium” plan, which would charge customers a higher price for access to high-fidelity audio, among other features, as Bloomberg reported last year.

For years, Spotify offered most customers two options — a free, advertising-supported music service with limited functionality and a paid listening product with unlimited access.

But the company has lost money every year since it went public in 2018, largely because it pays out about 70% of its sales in royalties to the music industry. Spotify paid record labels, artists and others more than $9 billion last year – from $13.2 billion in revenue.

Management has attempted to reduce Spotify’s reliance on the music industry by offering other types of entertainment.

The company dabbled in video before deciding to focus on offering many different kinds of audio. It began by pouring billions of dollars into podcasts, an emerging field of on-demand audio. While management has said podcasts will turn a profit this year, Spotify also fired thousands of employees and curtailed its investment in original audio programming.

Last year, the company announced big plans in audiobooks, a field dominated by Amazon.com Inc.’s Audible. While Audible customers must pay to listen to almost any book, Spotify offered its customers free, limited access. The results so far have been strong, at least in terms of consumption.

Spotify’s move into other kinds of programming has alarmed its partners in the music industry, who fret the company will try to reduce their royalties. As a result, major music companies have been pushing Spotify and its competitors to raise prices.

While Netflix Inc. has doubled the price of its most popular plan in recent years, Spotify only raised prices in major markets last year for the first time since introducing its premium audio service to the US in 2011. Despite concerns that some subscribers would cancel, the company posted its best year of user growth ever, with 113 million new sign-ups to its free and paid services.

Spotify had 602 million users at the end of 2023, including 236 million paying customers.

The success of the price increase has given management confidence to seek even more. Under the new pricing, individual plans will go up by about $1 a month, while family plans and so-called duo plans for couples will rise by $2.

Spotify’s biggest competitors, Apple Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., have also raised prices for their music services.

Music companies and audio services are also discussing ways to generate additional money from the most ardent fans. Currently, all listeners pay the same rate for access to a musician’s catalog. But there are fans willing to pay far more to support an artist they love, as evidenced by the rising price of concert tickets, merchandise and even vinyl for Korean artists.

Among the various options, streaming services have discussed charging people more for early access to new music. Yet the companies are reluctant to significantly alter the main paid product – such as Spotify’s $11-a-month, all-you-can-listen plan. Whether or not management figures out how to capitalize on the more-loyal fans, the cost of that main service is only going up."

Apple has dropped the interest rate on its Apple Card Savings account for the first time in 2024.

Apple Card Savings pays 4.40% APY (Annual Percentage Yield). Previously, the Apple Card Savings Account offered 4.50% APY.

The account is similar to high-yield savings accounts at the best online banks, although you can still earn higher rates with some other institutions. Several savings accounts are paying over 5% APY.

The Apple Card Savings account is available for Apple Card users in the U.S. You can set it up and manage it through the Apple Card in the Wallet app on iPhones. (Just make sure your iPhone is updated with iOS 16.4 or later.)

How the Apple Card Savings account works

The Apple Card Savings account doesn't require a minimum opening deposit. It also doesn't have monthly service fees or minimum balance requirements.

If an Apple Card user sets up a savings account, their Daily Cash rewards will automatically be deposited into the account. Daily Cash is a feature on the Apple Card where you can get up to 3% cash back on credit card purchases.

""Savings helps our users get even more value out of their favorite Apple Card benefit — Daily Cash — while providing them with an easy way to save money every day,"" says Jennifer Bailey, Apple's vice president of Apple Pay and Apple Wallet in a press release when the company originally launched the account. ""Our goal is to build tools that help users lead healthier financial lives, and building Savings into Apple Card in Wallet enables them to spend, send, and save Daily Cash directly and seamlessly — all from one place.""

The maximum amount of money you can keep in the high-yield savings account is $250,000. If you make a transfer that would cause your account to exceed the maximum balance limit, it may be denied.

To deposit or take out money from the Apple Card Savings account, you may link a bank account and initiate an ACH transfer. You could also move money to your Apple Cash card, which is a digital card available in the Apple Wallet.

Individual transfers must be between $1 and $10,000. You can also only transfer up to $20,000 from the account every seven days. You won't be able to deposit cash or make a wire transfer with this account.

Apple is not a bank. However, banking services are provided by Goldman Sachs, Member FDIC. Your account is insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) for up to $250,000 per depositor.

How the Apple Card Savings account compares to other high-yield savings accounts

The average interest rate on savings accounts in the U.S. is 0.46% APY, according to the FDIC. The FDIC is a government agency that oversees banks.

While the interest rate on the Apple Card Savings Account has dropped for the first time in 2024, it still pays a significantly higher rate than a traditional savings account.

You could earn 4.40% APY on your savings balance — this is more in line with the savings rates of high-yield savings accounts at online banks, like Ally Savings Account. Interest on the Apple Card Savings account is compounded daily and deposited into your account monthly.

A powerful earthquake that shook the east coast of Taiwan early Wednesday morning appears to have disrupted the operations of the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company — the world's biggest chip maker.

That could be an issue for major companies like Apple and Nvidia, which rely on its chips to power their technology.

The 7.4-magnitude earthquake — the island's strongest in the last 25 years — has reportedly killed nine and injured more than 900 others. It also damaged more than 100 buildings, according to the latest figures from The New York Times.

Apple is in the early stages of looking into making home robots, a move that appears to be an effort to create its ""next big thing"" after it killed its self-driving car project earlier this year, sources familiar with the matter told Bloomberg.

Engineers are looking into developing a robot that could follow users around their houses, Bloomberg reported. They're also exploring a tabletop at-home device that uses robotics to rotate the display, a more advanced project than the mobile robot.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The idea behind the smart display robot is to mimic a person's head movement, such as reacting during a FaceTime session. It would also include a feature that zooms in on a particular person in a crowd during a video call. This device initially caught the attention of senior Apple executives years ago, though they've disagreed over whether to continue with the project, Bloomberg said.

The report about Apple's new efforts comes after a series of recent blows to the company. Since the start of 2024, Apple has been hit with declining iPhone sales in China, a nearly $2 billion fine from the EU, and an antitrust lawsuit from the DOJ.

It also scrapped its decadeslong, multi-billionaire car effort, Project Titan, earlier this year, shifting its focus to building AI products. Apple has been criticized as lagging behind companies like OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google, which have all released chatbots.

The bet on home robots could be an attempt to regain its new-product mojo eventually. The company reportedly started exploring robotics in 2019. At the time, Doug Field, now an EV executive at Ford, was leading the project and was joined by leaders across the home product space to work on things like quiet indoor drones.

After Field left the company in 2021, Bloomberg says Apple's robotics efforts zeroed in on domestic products. One idea Apple explored was a robot that could do chores like washing dishes and be used for video calls. However, the concept was shelved because of engineering obstacles, according to Bloomberg.

It's not yet clear whether Apple's robots will make it to consumers. But Apple appears to have laid some groundwork. At least one engineer who used to be on the car project's hardware team has been moved to the home and robotics division, according to Bloomberg. Sources also say that SafetyOS, the operating system that would've given the car self-driving capabilities, could technically be repurposed for robots.

Still, home robotics are nothing new. The Roomba, for instance, is a popular autonomous vacuum cleaner created by iRobot that Amazon tried to acquire in 2022. Smart speakers and thermostats are also common in people's homes. Meantime, Apple's latest non-robotic launch, the Vision Pro, has had mixed reviews.

As Apple retreats from two ambitious projects, the tech giant has cut more than 600 employees in California, according to filings with the state.

On Tuesday, Apple filed a series of notices with the state about layoffs effective in late May for various Santa Clara offices. Bloomberg reported that one of the addresses was home to a display-development office, while the others were for the company's electric-car effort.

Lawyers for the family of Walter Huang, an engineer who was killed on his commute to work, say his former employer is “secretly” maneuvering to support Tesla’s attempt to blame distracted driving for the wreck. A National Transportation Safety Board investigation had failed to reach a definitive conclusion about what Huang was doing in the final seconds before impact.

Based on forensic examinations of Huang’s iPhone, Tesla has said he was playing Sega’s Total War: Three Kingdoms at the time of the crash, though the Huang family’s attorneys say Tesla can’t prove that just because the app was open on his screen.

The two sides are sparring over whether Tesla can call an Apple engineering manager as a witness for a two-month trial set to start next week in state court in San Jose. Apple representatives didn’t respond to a request for comment after regular business hours.

Tesla has prevailed in two previous California trials over Autopilot — the second one involving a fatal crash — in which the driver-assistance system was blamed after the vehicles veered off the road.

The company voluntarily recalled 2 million vehicles late last year after the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that Autopilot failed to ensure drivers stay attentive. Lawyers representing crash victims and family members who have sued Tesla over accidents say the determination bolsters their claims that the technology is defective and contributed to collisions.

Tesla obtained a sworn statement from an Apple engineering manager, James Harding, who analyzed unencrypted telemetry data on Huang’s phone and said it “suggests possible user interaction, which might be a screen touch or button press.”

The Huang family’s lawyers have countered in a court filing that Tesla purposefully hid its questioning of Harding from them until after pretrial fact-finding deadlines. They are now trying to force Apple to provide more information, and the iPhone maker is pushing back, saying that it shouldn’t have to hand over confidential material.

The NTSB said in a report that the probable cause of Huang’s crash into a barrier along Highway 101 in Mountain View was a combination of “limitations” with the Autopilot system and the driver’s “lack of response due to distraction likely from a cell phone game application and overreliance” on Autopilot.

The report noted that the Model X’s computer detected that Huang’s hands weren’t on the steering wheel just before the crash. Tesla’s owner’s manual says Autopilot users must remain engaged while driving.

The agency also faulted California’s highway department for failing to fix the barrier that Huang’s car collided with after it was damaged in a previous crash.

The case is Huang v. Tesla Inc., 19CV346663, California Superior Court, Santa Clara County (San Jose)."

Apple's decision to cut more than 600 employees in California speaks to the challenges facing the technology titan and affecting its stock price — and why analysts are divided over its outlook.

The iPhone maker is laying off or reassigning the workers as it reportedly pulls back from its electric vehicle and next-generation Apple Watch display projects.

At the same time, reports suggest Apple is looking into building robots that help people with household tasks. But some analysts have warned the initiative may be a costly distraction and might not bear fruit this decade.

""I put the probability that we see a product in the next 5 years at slim to none,"" Gene Munster, the managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, posted on X. ""As a reminder Apple works on a lot of things that never see the light of day.""

Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives struck a harsher tone in a CNBC interview this week.

""It would be a horror show if they actually spent money on robots,"" he said. ""They need to focus on AI. For Cook, his legacy is going to be AI. If they went after robots, that would be a black eye moment for Apple.""

Souring on the stock

Apple's reported dismantling of two projects and teams, and its pivot toward personal robotic helpers, will only fuel concerns that the company has lost focus and fallen behind its Big Tech peers in critical areas like AI.

Related stories

Worries that Apple has lost its way have weighed on its stock price. The shares have slumped 12% from their closing price at the end of 2023, cutting the company's value by more than $300 billion.

In contrast, the S&P 500 has climbed nearly 8% this year, and arch rival and OpenAI investor Microsoft has advanced about 11%.

Microsoft is now worth about half a trillion dollars more than Apple at $3.1 trillion.

Other pressures on the stock include concerns about overvaluation, flagging growth, rising tensions and slowing sales in China, high-profile clashes with regulators in the US and Europe, and less defensive cachet among investors as recession fears fade.

Even so, Apple is a mainstay of many stock portfolios and unlikely to fall much further, Craig Johnson, chief market technician at Piper Sandler, told Bloomberg.

""Nobody wants to sell any more of their Apple positions because there's a dividend, big share buybacks, and no one wants to pay capital-gains taxes on it,"" he said.

Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate owns almost 6% of Apple, has hailed it as a ""family jewel"" and ""probably the best business"" he knows. The legendary investor has also praised the company's buybacks as they've gradually raised Berkshire's ownership stake without it spending a penny.

'Attractive place'

Johnson echoed Buffett's views in a Yahoo Finance interview. He praised Apple's financial strength, solid profit margins, buybacks, and business model that drives repeat purchases. He also pitched it as a haven if stocks tumble.

""With a market that looks like it's setting itself up for a good 5 to 10% correction, Apple looks like a pretty attractive place for people to park their money,"" he said.

The workers were cut from eight offices in Santa Clara, according to the filings under the state’s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, also known as WARN. But it’s not clear which departments or projects the employees were involved in.

Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment early Friday.

The Cupertino, California, company had been a notable exception as other tech companies slashed their workforces over the past two years. There was a massive surge in hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people spent more time and money online, and big tech companies are still larger than they were before the pandemic. Still, as growth slows, companies are focusing on cutting costs.

In a recent regulatory filing, Apple said it had about 161,000 full-time equivalent employees.

Amazon announced earlier this week a fresh round of layoffs, this time at its cloud computing business AWS. In recent months, video game maker Electronic Arts said it’s cutting about 5% of its workforce, Sony said its axing about 900 jobs in its PlayStation division, Cisco Systems revealed plans to lay off more than 4,000 workers and social media company Snap, owner of Snapchat, announced its slashing 10% of its global workforce."

Things have been getting a little more serious over in Cupertino this year for Tim Cook.

The latest sign of the mood change came Thursday after it emerged that Apple had laid off over 600 employees in California. The news came from filings with the California Employment Development Department first reported by Bloomberg.

In a year when the tech industry has already cut almost 60,000 employees — with Apple's Big Tech peers slashing a considerable number more from their workforces since they began layoffs in 2023 — that might not seem like a big deal. That's especially so when considering that Apple had about 161,000 full-time employees at the end of its last fiscal year.

That said, the move to let go of employees at a firm that rarely makes cuts has significance.

Affected employees included those involved in expensive research-and-development projects, such as Apple's secretive electric-vehicle work, which was scrapped in February and had cost $1 billion a year since 2014, and a complex in-house project to make brighter smartwatch screens with microLED technology.

In other words, layoffs of employees on these projects — which were reported to have been shut down at the same time and had no immediate end in sight — signal that Apple's CEO is making the company more focused.

There's no shortage of reasons for doing so.

Cook's stewardship of Apple faces perhaps its biggest challenge since he took over as CEO in 2011. The company's stock was down by over 10% at the end of March compared with the start of the year as it faced challenges on several fronts demanding its full attention.

One of its biggest headaches involves the product that has been its reliable workhorse over the years: the iPhone.

Since the beginning of the year, the smartphone has faced sales pressure in China, in particular — Apple's most important international market — with rival offerings such as Huawei's 5G-enabled Mate 60 Pro earning favor among consumers over the latest generation of iPhones.

Apple's iPhone 15 family of devices. Apple

Data published in March by Counterpoint Research, for example, shows that iPhone sales fell 24% in the first six weeks of 2024, while overall shipments in February were 33% lower than in the same month a year ago, per Bloomberg.

Though Apple's AI announcements coming late this year could reveal new features that make iPhones seem more attractive again, Apple's secrecy over what it has been working on makes it difficult to know how its efforts on the technology of the moment compare to its rivals.

The company has also committed to the unproven sector of mixed reality, following the February release of its $3,500 Vision Pro headset. Though Cook has touted it as an immersive vision of computing that gives users an ""infinite canvas,"" consumer interest has been slow to emerge.

As my colleague Peter Kafka has noted, influential analysts like Ben Thompson have started to say the Vision Pro lacks sales-driving apps. Meanwhile, the likes of Mark Zuckerberg have been happily publishing critical teardowns.

Product issues aren't the only burden Apple faces, with the company facing legal battles of an immense scale in both the US and the European Union.

Last month, the Justice Department sued Apple, claiming that it had monopolized the smartphone market. In the EU, Apple has been facing regulators asking it to comply with the sweeping new rules of the Digital Markets Act, which aims to crack open its App Store.

Apple's recently announced foray into developing home robots could end up being a ""horror show"" for the company, according to Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

Speaking to CNBC this week, Ives referenced a Bloomberg report that Apple is exploring the creation of home robots, with an eye on that becoming the tech giant's ""next big thing."" The news came not long after the iPhone-maker dashed plans to roll out a self-driving car, a decade-long project known as Project Titan.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Ives thinks such a shift would be detrimental to Apple, which should instead be primarily focused on leaning into artificial intelligence.

""It would be a horror if they actually spent money on robots. Look at the failed EV initiative, Project Titan,"" Ives said. ""For Cook, his legacy is going to be AI. If they went after robots, that would be a black eye moment for Apple.""

Other strategists on Wall Street have also sounded doubts over Apple's robot development. Gene Munster, who has been bullish on the iPhone maker for years, noted that the company has shelved plenty of projects over the years before ever rolling them out to the public.

""I 100% agree it makes sense for Apple to have a small skunkworks project exploring a deeper dive into home automation. That said, I put the probability that we see a product in the next five years at slim to none,"" Munster said in a post on X.

Apple has faced a number of negative headwinds and headlines over the last year, stemming from restrictions in China, an anti-trust lawsuit from the Department of Justice, and recent layoffs. Shares of its stock have slid 12% from levels at the start of 2024.

Even amid his concern around Apple's home robots, Ives remains bullish on the company's stock trajectory over the medium-term. In Wedbush's latest note on Apple, the firm maintained its ""outperform"" rating on the stock and 12-month price target of $250, implying shares will rise 47%. But that projection hinges on Apple continuing to put its AI at the forefront of its priorities, the analysts suggested.

Tesla is set to go to trial next week over a lawsuit brought against it in 2019 over the role its Autopilot feature played in the fatal crash of Wei ""Walter"" Huang, an Apple engineer.

And now, in the 11th hour, Tesla hopes to involve Apple itself in the case by calling an engineer as a witness in an attempt to prove Huang was at fault for the collision.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

Tesla plans to introduce a sworn statement from the Apple employee to argue that Huang, who died in 2018 after his Model X crashed into a safety barrier while the vehicle was on Autopilot, was distracted while playing a game on his iPhone, according to court documents viewed by Business Insider.

The family of Huang filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against Tesla in 2019, accusing the automaker's Autopilot feature of being ""defective in its design."" The family argued that because of what it said were faults of the feature, Tesla was responsible for Huang's death.

The company told BI in 2018 that the only explanation for the crash was Huang's inattentiveness, an argument that the carmaker continues to rely on as it faces legal battles regarding its Autopilot function.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment.

An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board previously found that while there was no singular cause for the crash, Tesla's Autopilot had ""system limitations,"" adding that Huang had a game open on his phone, with him putting too much faith in the Autopilot function before the crash.

However, investigators were unable to determine whether Huang was actively playing the game before the collision, according to the NTSB report. Huang's family argues that he was letting the game run passively on his phone.

Now, with the case set to go to trial on Monday, Tesla introduced a sworn statement from an Apple employee. It's also seeking to call the Apple employee as a witness in the trial, but attorneys for Huang's family are pushing back.

The written statement from the Apple engineer James Harding claims that data extracted from Huang's iPhone 8 showed he was actively on his phone at the time of the crash.

Attorneys representing the Huang family accused Apple in recently filed court documents of ""engaging in a secret discovery 'work around' to help support Tesla in its defense.""

The Huang family's attorneys said Tesla revealed the first sworn statement signed by Harding five months after the discovery process ended and then produced the second sworn statement only three days before trial.

An Apple spokesperson and an attorney for the Huang family declined to comment.

Following Harding's more recent sworn statement, attorneys for the Huang family subpoenaed Apple to acquire more information about Harding's testimony. However, Apple argued that the attorneys were asking for a ""substantial volume"" of ""privileged"" material.

Apple said in an application to quash the subpoena that it was ""not a party to this case, has never appeared, and has not received any notice of entry of order relating to the dispute.""

""While Apple is ready to work in good faith with the Parties and to fulfill its obligations as a non-party witness, it is very unclear on its present obligations and seeks guidance from the Court,"" the filing said.

By attempting to quash the subpoena by the plaintiffs and seeking a protective order, Apple is trying to prevent attorneys from questioning Harding before the trial, the Huang family said in a March 29 court filing.

It wasn't a surprise to Julie Lenkoff's family that she was going on another cruise.

The 80-year-old has visited 120 countries, speaks 10 languages, and has been on countless cruises. Lenkoff is an experienced traveler, so no one batted an eye when she boarded a 21-day Norwegian cruise along the coast of Africa by herself on March 20, Kurt Gies, Lenkoff's son-in-law, told Business Insider.

But her family was shocked when another cruise passenger phoned Lenkoff's daughter, Lana Gies, to tell her they were with Lenkoff, Kurt said. She had been released from a hospital, could hardly speak, was losing her vision, and was on the African island of São Tomé and Príncipe.

Kurt told BI Lenkoff had a stroke during a cruise-sponsored excursion and that the tour operator and cruise company left her at a hospital, where she was later discharged and left to figure out her own way home.

Kurt said a group of stranded tourists helped Lenkoff return to the US, where she remains in serious condition at the Stanford Medical Center.

""We had the means, the technology, and the ability to navigate this massive network to get her home,"" Kurt said. ""I can only imagine if a family didn't or if that person was truly by themselves. What would've happened?""

The family says they have other stranded cruisers to thank for Lenkoff's return

On March 27, day eight of the Norwegian cruise, passengers disembarked the ship to explore São Tomé and Príncipe.

Kurt said Lenkoff joined a cruise-sponsored excursion with the tour company Navetur Equatour. During the tour, she passed out and fell, Diogo Beirão, the chief operating officer of the tour company, confirmed to BI. When Lenkoff regained consciousness, he said she couldn't speak English and had lost feeling in the right side of her body.

At the time, Beirão said the main concern was if Lenkoff had broken a bone or experienced a concussion. Kurt said doctors in the US later confirmed that Lenkoff had a stroke.

Beirão told BI that his tour guides brought Lenkoff back to the dock, where he says a nurse from the Norwegian cruise evaluated her on the pier.

In a statement sent to BI, a Norwegian cruise representative said that ""on March 27, 2024, an 80-year-old woman was medically disembarked after being evaluated by our onboard medical team, who thought it best that she receive further assessment and treatment as needed from a local hospital.""

Beirão said Lenkoff was transported to the closest hospital, which was ""not very comfortable"" because it ""had no private rooms, just curtains."" However, Beirão said he believes it was the right decision not to let her reboard the cruise.

Kurt said Norwegian brought Lenkoff the belongings from her room; however, her credit cards and cash were lost. He added that the tour company later found the missing wallet in a tour van, which was brought to Lenkoff more than 24 hours after she was released from the hospital.

Kurt said he and the rest of Lenkoff's family had no idea this was happening since Norwegian hadn't contacted them.

Meanwhile, a group of eight people were on a separate, private tour of São Tomé and Príncipe. BI previously reported that the tour ran into issues, and the group missed the ship's boarding deadline.

The group was stranded on the island without cash or medications and with one working credit card, which passengers Jill and Jay Campbell owned. The group found a hotel, contacted the closest American consulate, and planned to meet the ship at its next port in the Gambia.

As all this was happening, Kurt said, Lenkoff was released from the hospital.

Beirão said he was unaware that Lenkoff had a stroke, but he visited her at the hospital, and ""she was not totally functional"" but ""could speak very well."" While Lenkoff could communicate, Beirão said she often forgot what she was trying to say mid-sentence.

In Norwegian's statement, the representative said: ""We attempted to call the guest several times, and as we were unable to reach her, we worked directly with our port agent in São Tomé and Príncipe, an African island nation, to receive updates about the guest.""

""In instances such as these,"" the statement continued, ""as the guest was released from the hospital and in a coherent state, our protocol is to contact the guest directly, as we would not have the authority to share any medical details with anyone else without their expressed consent.""

Kurt said there are no phone or WhatsApp records of Norwegian reaching out on her cellphone, and he believes that family members should've been contacted in this instance since the company could not reach Lenkoff to confirm she was in a coherent state.

After being discharged, Kurt said the tour company connected the Americans with Lenkoff.

""You have people figuring out how they're getting off this island, and they're given the responsibility to take care of an 80-year-old woman who just had a stroke,"" Kurt said.

At the time, Lenkoff had no way to pay for anything, so the Campbells provided Lenkoff with food and a place to sleep, Kurt said.

""I truly believe sometimes we're put in certain places for a reason, and I believe we were put in this place for the 80-year-old woman who was left alone. God forbid what would have happened to that lady if we were not here,"" Jay Campbell told North Carolina's WRAL.

Kurt said Lenkoff was still having trouble speaking and had started to lose her vision.

Using Lenkoff's phone, Jill Campbell called Lenkoff's daughter to tell her what happened. Around the same time, the American consulate called, though Kurt said the family was unsure how the consulate learned about Lenkoff's state.

Kurt said he and Lana attempted to reach Norwegian multiple times but couldn't connect with anyone at the company.

""It was decided that we need to get Julie off that island,"" he said. ""No one at Norwegian was going to take responsibility for it.""

The Norwegian representative told BI Lenkoff had been ""escorted on a flight to Lisbon, Portugal, and then put in the care of airport staff to continue her journey to the United States, where she has now made a safe return.""

Kurt said all of Lenkoff's travel arrangements were ""made by her family"" and that it wasn't Norwegian who escorted her, adding that the ""airlines took responsibility for ensuring she got safely on each plane segment during her journey home.""

He said Lenkoff flew to Lisbon, then to Toronto, and finally to San Francisco.

Thankfully, he said, Lana had sent her mom with an Apple AirTag so the family could watch Lenkoff make the trip back to the US.

The Apple product has become popular for tracking everything from missing suitcases to lost golfing equipment and a magician's sound equipment. Some parents are even using them to keep track of their children. According to Benzinga, Apple sold $1 billion worth of Airtags within two years of releasing the tracking device.

Kurt said he and Lana used the AirTag to follow Lenkoff in Lisbon as she reached her next gate.

""We were able to track her movement across the world as she was coming home, and that was a huge relief for us,"" he said.

Once Lenkoff arrived in California, Kurt said she was medically evacuated to the Stanford Medical Center.

""They pull her out on a gurney and this huge smile comes across her face as she sees her daughter for the first time,"" he told BI.

Today, Lenkoff is in critical condition

Since arriving at the hospital in California, Kurt told BI that Lenkoff has undergone numerous tests and scans. He said doctors believe she may have also had a heart attack, and while she was at the Stanford Medical Center, she experienced a second stroke.

Kurt said Lenkoff remains in a serious condition.

Meanwhile, the Gieses have continued to try to reach Norwegian. Kurt said two junior staffers have reached out to learn more about what happened, but he said no one from the cruise line had taken responsibility for not contacting Lenkoff's emergency contacts.

Kurt said the experience has taught him and his family that they should not rely on cruise companies to keep passengers safe.

Kurt heard from the Campbells that the group made it back on the ship on Wednesday. When everyone is healthy and back in the US, he said they plan to meet with the Campbells to thank them.

""We truly believe that our mother would've died had she been left to her own devices,"" Kurt said. ""The Campbells are now members of our family. They are the true heroes of this story.""

Tesla has settled a high-profile case that was set to put the electric car company and its controversial automated-driving system on trial starting Monday.

Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. Jury selection was set to begin Monday in a wrongful death suit filed by the family of a former Apple engineer who died after his Tesla Model X crashed while the Autopilot feature was engaged. The trial could have lasted several weeks, but the parties settled Monday.

Walter Huang was killed when his Tesla struck a concrete highway median in Silicon Valley on March 23, 2018. The National Transportation Safety Board, in its investigation, found that Autopilot was engaged for nearly 19 minutes before the fatal crash, when the car, traveling at 71 mph, veered off the highway.

The settlement marks another crucial moment for an embattled company that has lost popularity and a third of its market value this year. CEO Elon Musk and the company say that its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving technologies are ahead of the competition and a big reason why Tesla has become the world’s largest electric vehicle maker — just ahead of Chinese rival BYD. But Huang’s family said Tesla oversold its Autopilot technology’s capabilities, and that it is not as safe to use as advertised.

Representatives for Huang’s family and Tesla did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Tesla has come under intense scrutiny for its Autopilot technology over the six years since Huang’s fatal crash. After a two-year investigation that analyzed 1,000 Tesla crashes while vehicles had Autopilot engaged, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the Autopilot system can give drivers a false sense of security. It can be easily misused in certain dangerous situations when Autopilot may be unable to safely navigate the road, NHTSA found in December 2023.

NHTSA and the National Transportation Safety Board have also been investigating crashes involving Tesla vehicles using the various driver assist features, including a series of crashes into emergency vehicles on the scene of other accidents.

Immediately following the December NHTSA report, Tesla recalled all 2 million of its cars in the United States, giving drivers more warnings when Autopilot is engaged and they are not paying attention to the road or placing their hands on the wheel.

Yet the company maintains that the technology is safe to use when used correctly and reduces fatalities. Autopilot requires drivers to keep their hands on the wheel and Tesla says people who use the automated-driving technology should keep their eyes on the road.

That didn’t happen in the case of Huang’s crash, Tesla has said. In a March 30, 2018, blog post, Tesla said Huang’s hands were not detected on his car’s steering wheel for six seconds prior to the crash. The company said it believes Huang was responsible for the crash because investigators found he was playing a video game on his phone while Autopilot was engaged. Huang did not brake or attempt to steer his car away from the concrete barrier before it crashed.

Although Huang’s family acknowledges he was distracted while the car was driving, they argued Tesla is at fault because it falsely marketed Autopilot as self-driving software. They alleged Tesla knew that Autopilot was not ready for prime time and had flaws that could make its use unsafe.

Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the allegations.

“Mrs. Huang lost her husband, and two children lost their father because Tesla is beta testing its Autopilot software on live drivers,” said B. Mark Fong, the lawyer who brought the suit filed in California state court in a May 2019 complaint.

If a jury had found in favor of Huang’s family, Tesla could have been forced to pay damages, and they could have added up quickly. Wrongful death suits involving big companies have at times resulted in awards north of $1 billion.

Autopilot’s promise has also helped to boost Tesla’s stock in recent years to make it the most valuable automaker in the world — even as its stock is among the worst-performers in 2024. Musk in October 2023 on a call with analysts said autonomous driving “has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far.”

Tesla’s stock (TSLA) rose 5% Monday."

If your iPad has been collecting dust at home, Apple is hoping an impressive new screen will convince you to upgrade.

The tech giant is reportedly upgrading its iPad Pros with OLED displays, known for their deep contrast ratios — a first for the product line, Bloomberg reported. Apple first introduced OLED displays to the iPhone with the iPhone X back in 2017.

""The technology apparently looks amazing on such large displays — taking what iPhone users have experienced since 2017 to a whole new level,"" Bloomberg's Mark Gurman wrote in his report on the upcoming iPad Pro.

Related stories

Don't be surprised if the prices for the new iPad Pros go up as a result, as OLED displays typically cost more to manufacture. The hardware changes represent the first major overhaul to the Pro lineup since 2018, according to the report.

Apple is also updating its iPad Air with a 12.9-inch screen — bigger than the display of its previous Air models, Bloomberg reported.

New versions of its Magic Keyboard and the Apple Pencil stylus are also expected, according to the report.

The new products may only be a month away, Bloomberg reported, with a likely launch anticipated for the week of May 6. Apple didn't immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment on the report ahead of publication.

The iPad revamp appears to be part of Apple's efforts to increase tablet sales after revenue from the product line fell for two years in a row. Apple could also use the extra revenue as it seeks to combat declining iPhone sales in China, a major market.

If they generate enough interest, the new iPads could prove to be a bright spot on Apple's nightmarish start to the year. Since the beginning of 2024, the tech company killed its self-driving car project, got hit with a DOJ antitrust lawsuit, and now faces a nearly $2 billion fine in the EU — all while lagging behind on AI.

It sounds like Apple may be looking to flip the script though on the perception that its AI advancements have been lacking. The company is expected to show off the next version of its iPhone software, iOS 18, in a couple of months, and the AI features that Tim Cook has been teasing will reportedly be front and center."

Apple isn't going to make a supercar, after all. Its Vision Pro headset is a cool curiosity searching for a killer app. And you already have an iPhone.

So what's the next would-be-mind-blowing product for Tim Cook?

Well, home robots, maybe. But those aren't coming out anytime soon. In the meantime we may see something decidedly less ambitious out of Apple: New iPads.

But not just any new iPads, reports Bloomberg's Mark Gurman. These iPads would be cheaper than a regular iPad, and instead of doing lots of stuff, these would do… not that much. Gurman writes:

One piece of the strategy is a lightweight smart display — something akin to a low-end iPad. Such a device could be shuttled from room to room as needed and hooked into charging hubs stationed around the house. Apple has started small-scale test production of the screens for this product, but hasn't made a decision on whether to move forward.

Gurman, who's very deeply sourced at Apple, says the new, cheapish iPads could be part of a renewed ""smart home"" push, along with a new Apple TV box that would have a built-in camera for FaceTime chats.

But I was a little confused about Gurman's report. Cheap iPads already exist, right? You can get one from Apple for $349. What would be new here? And what would you do with one that you wouldn't do with the iPhone and/or iPad you already own?

So I asked him, via email.

He was kind enough to respond:

""[It] would be similar to the Google Pixel tablet with the dock. The idea would be that it's a home iPad dedicated for things you do at home, like controlling your smart home controls, FaceTime, video watching etc. I think you're right it wouldn't do much different than [a] phone or existing iPad. But it would probably be cheaper than a normal iPad. It would be like a more portable Facebook portal. I'm not certain they'll end up launching it. No final decision yet.""

Thank you, Mark!

And as far as Apple's potential new line of iPads... I dunno. On the one hand: I own a bunch of devices that can do all of these things. So do my parents, who I imagine might be the target audience for these. And while I've never heard of the Google Pixel, I had heard of the Facebook Portal, and... Facebook doesn't sell those anymore.

On the other hand: My colleague Katie Notopoulos loved the Facebook Portal. And I think more people might have been into a cheap, mostly dedicated video-chatting device if it 1) didn't require them to use Facebook Messenger, and 2) didn't have anything to do with Facebook. I can easily imagine one sitting in my parent's kitchen, honestly. Maybe they'd watch videos with it, too.

The smart home stuff? Not so much. The only time I ever think about smart homes is when I visit someone who has a smart home and 1) they are always a guy and 2) I think the only time they actually use their smart home features is when someone comes over to visit and they want to show it off.

(Also I assume people who are buying $200 Nanoleaf Shapes Hexagons don't need a dedicated device to control them because they're already hardcore Apple people who are constantly whipping out their phone to change their Nanoleaf Shapes Hexagons colors or whatever.)

But you never know: I spent decades not wearing a watch, and now if I forget to put on my Apple Watch before I leave the house I get anxious about losing my steps for the day. So let's wait and see if Apple actually brings these things to market."

Taylor Swift fans are eagerly speculating that her forthcoming album might dive into her split from ex-boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, and her latest promotional activity seems to support this theory.

In anticipation of her new album, The Tortured Poets Department, the 34-year-old singer has created five Apple Music playlists, each representing one of ""the five stages of heartbreak"": denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. Swifties have definitely scoured these playlists for clues about her breakup with Alwyn, and some have dug up some gold.

""Putting together a playlist of love songs about Joe and calling it 'I Love You It's Ruining My Life' is insane,"" said one X (formerly Twitter) user.

Another user excitedly wrote, ""TAYLOR PUTTING LAVENDER HAZE AS THE VERY FIRST SONG ON HER ""DENIAL"" SONGS PLAYLIST?????? SHE'S SPILLING.""

The first playlist, titled ""I Love You, It's Ruining My Life,"" hints at significant revelations, perhaps about a past relationship. Swift introduced this playlist with a note: ""This is a list of songs about getting so caught up in the idea of something that you have a hard time seeing the red flags, possibly resulting in moments of denial and maybe a little bit of delusion.""

Notably, ""Lavender Haze,"" the opening song on the playlist, seems like a deliberate choice since Swift pretty much admitted the song was inspired by Alwyn and their six year relationship in a deleted Instagram Reel. ""If you were in the lavender haze, then that meant that you were in that all-encompassing love glow, and I thought that was really beautiful,"" she said in the now deleted clip.

The pop star went on to highlight the challenges of maintaining a relationship in the public eye, particularly against a backdrop of relentless rumors and tabloid scrutiny: ""Like my relationship for six years, we've had to dodge weird rumors, tabloid stuff, and we just ignore it... And so this song is sort of about the act of ignoring that stuff to protect the real stuff.""

As she maneuvers through the rumors about her past relationship, Swift's ongoing romance with Chiefs Tight End Travis Kelce presents an exciting new chapter that fans are eager to analyze. The anticipation builds as fans await the April 19 release of her new album, eager to discover how her current emotions and experiences will be translated in her newest songs."

Tesla settled a wrongful-death lawsuit brought by the family of an Apple engineer who died after his Tesla crashed while in Autopilot mode, according to court records viewed by Business Insider.

Details of the settlement, which was filed on Monday, were not disclosed. The settlement came just as the case was set to go to trial on Monday in California's Santa Clara County Superior Court.

The family of Walter Huang, a 38-year-old engineer at Apple, sued Tesla in 2019, alleging the Tesla Model X SUV he was driving when he died was ""defective in its design."" The lawsuit claimed the March 23, 2018, crash was caused by Tesla's autopilot software.

Related stories

""Mrs. Huang lost her husband, and two children lost their father because Tesla is beta testing its Autopilot software on live drivers,"" attorney B. Mark Fong, who was representing Huang's family, said in a statement at the time. ""The Huang family wants to help prevent this tragedy from happening to other drivers using Tesla vehicles or any semi-autonomous vehicles.""

Representatives for Tesla and the Huang family did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.

Several lawsuits have been filed against Tesla related to its Autopilot feature, but this appears to be the first time the company has settled, The Washington Post reported.

A lengthy civil trial may have been a negative spectacle for Tesla, but one expert in automotive technologies previously told BI before the settlement was public that the company was unlikely to face serious consequences.

""This is one case, and Tesla will be able to absorb whatever final damages it ends up with, if any,"" Bryant Walker Smith, a law professor at the University of South Carolina, said of the possibility of Tesla losing the trial. However, he said it could ""bolster regulatory scrutiny"" around Autopilot modes.

Tesla filed a motion to have the settlement amount sealed.

The lawsuit said that Huang was driving on Highway 101 in Mountain View, California, approaching an exit ramp when his Tesla's autopilot turned the car out of the designated lane and straight into a concrete barrier while traveling around 70 mph.

An investigation conducted by the National Transportation Safety Board determined the Autopilot and the inattention of Huang were likely factors in the crash. The NTSB had concluded Huang was likely playing a game on his phone before the crash.

Tesla has previously blamed Huang for the crash in court filings. The company said Huang knew the car was not ""autonomous"" and that he was ""not paying attention."" The company has said that the crash could have been avoided had Huang been paying attention."

The size of the settlement was not disclosed in court documents filed Monday, just a day before the trial stemming from the 2018 crash on a San Francisco Bay Area highway was scheduled to begin.

The family Walter Huang filed a negligence and wrongful death lawsuit in 2019 seeking to hold Tesla — and, by extension, its CEO Elon Musk — liable for repeatedly exaggerating the capabilities of Tesla’s self-driving car technology. They claimed the technology, dubbed Autopilot, was promoted in egregious ways that caused vehicle owners to believe they didn’t have to remain vigilant while they were behind the wheel.

Evidence indicated that Huang was playing a video game on his iPhone when he crashed into a concrete highway barrier on March 23, 2018.

After dropping his son off at preschool, Huang activated the Autopilot feature on his Model X for his commute to his job at Apple. But less than 20 minutes later, Autopilot veered the vehicle out of its lane and began to accelerate before barreling into a barrier located at a perilous intersection on a busy highway in Mountain View, California. The Model X was still traveling at more than 70 miles per hour (110 kilometers per hour).

Huang, 38, died at the gruesome scene, leaving behind his wife and two children, now 12 and 9 years old.

The case was just one of about a dozen scattered across the U.S. raising questions about whether Musk’s boasts about the effectiveness of Tesla’s autonomous technology fosters a misguided faith in the company’s Autopilot and Full Self Driving, or FSD, mode. The U.S. Justice Department also opened an inquiry last year into how Tesla and Musk promote its autonomous technology, according to regulatory filings that didn’t provide many details about the nature of the probe.

Tesla, which is based in Austin, Texas, prevailed last year in a Southern California trial focused on whether misperceptions about Tesla’s Autopilot feature contributed to a driver in a 2019 crash involving one of the company’s cars."

This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Sandeep Rao, a 32-year-old software engineer based in San Jose, California. Business Insider has verified his income with documentation. This essay has been edited for length and clarity.

My salary journey in Big Tech has seen my total compensation — which includes base salary, bonuses, and stocks — increase from $15,000 in 2012 to $685,000 in 2024.

I'm a staff software engineer and have worked at three different tech companies, moving from Oracle to Apple to Meta. Over my career, I've led the development of successful software apps and features from scratch that are used every day by millions of people across the world.

While I have made my career moves primarily based on which areas of software engineering I'd get to work on, compensation is also important to me, so I've been strategic and negotiated for higher salaries with each move.

Tech companies use tools like additional equity to retain high-performing employees. In my experience, if you're consistently a top performer at your organization, it's certainly possible to keep your pay at or above market level and have a rewarding career within your company.

I took a low-paying job to get my foot in the door

While I got my undergraduate degree in electrical engineering, I realized midway through college that software engineering was my passion and pivoted to pursue a career in software instead.

My first job was as a software developer at Oracle in India. While Oracle isn't generally low-paying in the tech industry, my salary of 850,000 rupees, or $15,000, was low compared to what new grads were making at that time in competing Big Tech companies like Microsoft or Amazon because it was a ""take it or leave it"" new grad offer.

The work was unappealing to me because it didn't align with my career interests — I didn't want to continue building expertise in that specific area of software engineering — but I took it to get my foot in the door of a Big Tech company and build credibility.

I knew I eventually wanted to end up where all the action is — Silicon Valley. I worked at Oracle from 2012 to 2014, and during this time, I applied to graduate schools in the US because I felt a formal computer science degree would help me compete with the talented people in the Valley.

I got accepted into a graduate program in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. I left behind my family and friends in India and moved to the US with nothing but a suitcase and $65,000 in student debt.

Grad school was hard, but the doors it opened for me made the struggle worth it.

I was ecstatic to get a job at Apple

I finished grad school and got a job as a software engineer at Apple in Cupertino, California, where my base salary was $115,000.

I was ecstatic to work at one of the best companies in the world and felt my dreams were coming true. But I realized I wanted to work on more direct user-facing applications rather than on technology that ran under the hood.

Initially, I considered looking for new opportunities within Apple, but between high taxes, the high cost of living, and my student loans, I felt more compelled to switch companies, given that I'd likely receive a significant salary bump.

I had gotten a very small cost-of-living raise on my base salary at Apple, but it wasn't significant; not getting a bigger raise wasn't a big motivator in my decision to change companies, but it certainly made my choice easier.

My negotiation skills helped me get a 10% salary increase

At the end of 2017, I moved to Meta (then Facebook) in Menlo Park, California. I wanted to experience the culture of younger internet-based companies whose products are used by billions of people.

When I received my offer, I did my research to get a clear understanding of what my market value was and what salary I wanted to land on. I also learned what parts of my total compensation are negotiable, such as stocks and the sign-on bonus, and what is non-negotiable, like base salary and annual bonuses.

I was prepared to negotiate and walked away with an offer of $140,000, which was 10% more than their original offer.

In 2021, I landed a large-scale project at Meta that added a lot of value to the Messenger app and worked with several cross-functional teams across engineering, design, data science, and legal.

My accomplishments, such as this one, and high performance at work got me the promotions, visibility, and leverage to negotiate for higher pay and a successful salary journey.

Every year between 2018 to 2023, my base salary increased — as did my total compensation — through a combination of performance-based yearly stock refreshers, additional boosts from promotions, and stock market appreciation.

In 2024, I'm projected to make $685,000 through a combination of base salary, bonuses, and stock.

Five strategies for increasing my compensation package

Over the years, I learned five salary strategies that helped me grow my salary and overall compensation:

Advertisement

1. Always do your homework about market rates for your role, level, and location — especially when you switch jobs.

Switching jobs is a good way to increase your income.

Even if money may not be the primary motivator for a job switch, I always make sure to be conscious and strategic about my compensation by doing salary research to avoid leaving any money on the table.

When I started doing salary research during my switch to Meta, I found out my market value was much higher than what I was making at Apple at that time. This helped me start my negotiations with Meta at the market rate rather than the salary I was making.

I used Levels.fyi, Blind, and Glassdoor to find salary information and clearly understand my market value. Keep yourself updated on these benchmarks even if you don't plan on a job change anytime soon, so you know you're on par with the market, and any salary difference is offset by other factors such as better work-life balance.

Advertisement

2. Never let your bad salary ""baggage"" carry over to your new job.

If your salary isn't up to market standards right now, don't let it affect your pay at the next job. Otherwise, it'll lead to a cycle where you'll be underpaid for the rest of your career.

Employers and recruiters could use your salary history to give you only a modest raise, while your actual market value could easily be double or triple your most recent salary.

In California, labor laws make it illegal for employers to ask you about your current salary and salary history. You're also allowed to ask potential employers for the pay range for the position you're applying for.

If your state has similar protections, just being aware of this law can help you make any corrections to your pay during negotiations. This helped me start offer negotiations from my market value instead of my current pay.

Advertisement

3. Sometimes, you have to take a leap of faith to make that 10x impact on your career.

That could involve switching from a non-tech job to a tech job or taking a short-term hit for long-term gain. For example, I picked Oracle for my first job despite the low pay and unappealing work so I could build credibility to get into a Tier 1 grad school.

I also took a loan of about $65,000 to pay for Carnegie Mellon, even though I could have chosen to go to a cheaper public university.

Deciding to work at Oracle and attend Carnegie Mellon cost me a few years and a lot of debt, but doing so opened doors unlike anything else, and I haven't looked back ever since.

4. Negotiate to keep your base salary from falling behind

It's inevitable for your salary to fall behind as you stay longer at a company, especially in tech due to restricted stock unit (RSU) ""cliffs.""

Advertisement

Most RSU packages offered to new employees in the tech industry have a two- to four-year vesting period. Unless the employer offers a significant pay bump along the way, total compensation usually takes a drop after this vesting period. Many companies also offer annual performance-based stock refreshers to lower this salary gap, but they're usually not as large as the initial grant.

If you love working at your company and feel forced to move just to get a raise, you can ask your senior leadership to make a ""correction."" After all, it's much more expensive and time-consuming for employers to hire new people than to retain good employees.

Most Big Tech companies have employee retention programs like additional or discretionary equity. Additional equity programs are mainly used to retain high-performing employees, so they're usually highly selective.

This is how I was able to keep my compensation at or above market level despite spending six years at Meta. When I was reaching the end of my vesting period in my fourth year, I had a conversation with my senior leadership to see if there was any room for a pay correction so I could go back to focusing on my work 100% without worrying about salary.

Advertisement

Being prepared with my predicted compensation drop and market data greatly helped me build a cogent narrative going in. If you're consistently a top performer at your organization, it's certainly possible to keep your pay at or above market level and have a rewarding career within your company.

5. Don't assume people will reward your work or anticipate your needs — ask.

Always ask for what you want, whether it's a raise or that interesting project that just came in. The worst that will happen is you'll get a ""no."" If you don't ask, nobody will know, or even worse, people may assume that you're happy with what you have and move on.

I used this strategy when I heard of a new company initiative and asked to be a founding engineer because I was looking to create more impact in my role. Despite the high risk and ambiguity involved, I successfully delivered on the projects, which eventually led to a promotion. None of this would've been possible if I hadn't asked.

At the end of the day, you're your biggest advocate when it comes to your salary and career journey. There's no substitute for hard work, but being strategic about how you achieve your goals can go a long way. Sometimes, you have to take big risks and step out of your comfort zone to get that high-paying dream job.

Apple stock has had a disappointing year so far, but there are still reasons for investors to stay bullish on the iPhone maker, according to Wedbush.

The firm pointed to a ""black cloud"" hanging over the company, with Apple shares sliding 10% for a loss of over $200 billion in market value so far in 2024. That loss comes amid demand concerns in China, where Apple is battling a government crackdown on iPhones and fierce competition from China-based rivals, like Huawei.

""It's clear that Apple is navigating one of the more difficult China demand environments we have seen the last 5 years as a combination of factors has created a perfect storm for Cupertino in this key market,"" analysts said in a note on Tuesday, estimating that iPhone sales in China would likely fall ""moderately"" below estimates in March.

But Apple stock still has the potential to deliver big gains this year, analysts said, maintaining their ""outperform"" rating and $250 price target on the stock, the highest estimate on Wall Street.

A rise to that level implies 48% upside for Apple, which Wedbush said could stem from five bullish factors:

iPhone sales could be strong overall this year. 2024 estimates are ""hittable"" despite some conservative 2025 estimates for iPhone sales, analysts noted. There could be pent-up demand for iPhones, given how many users are due for an upgrade. Wedbush estimated there were around 270 million iPhones that could be swapped for a newer version, especially as Apple is set to roll out its iPhone 16 this year. Services revenue for the company remains ""rock solid,"" Wedbush analysts said. Apple pulled record-high revenue from the services side of its business over the first quarter, according to its latest earnings report. The company is integrating AI into its devices. Apple is set to make an announcement on its progress with generative artificial intelligence at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, Wedbush predicted. Apple still dominates the smartphone market, with 2.2 billion of its devices being used around the world. That's the ""strongest installed base of any company,"" analysts noted.

Over the medium term, investors are eyeing Apple's next quarterly earnings report, which is set to roll out on May 2.

""The Street is bracing for a brutal March quarter and soft June guidance which we believe could be the last few quarters of this growth storm as Apple starts to see a renaissance of growth heading into the September quarter and FY25,"" Wedbush said. ""While some patience is required to navigate this China weakness, we believe the seeds for an Apple growth turnaround are being planted in the field.""

Most analysts on Wall Street have maintained a ""strong-buy"" rating for the stock, according to data from the Nasdaq Exchange. The average price target for Apple stood at $202 a share, implying a 20% upside for the stock."

But our David vs. Goliath battle against Apple has even reached President Joe Biden’s desk–and, now, the halls of Congress.

Some people ask me why we haven’t given up, given Apple’s massive war chest and well-documented history of copying other firms’ ideas. As The Washington Post once reported, “Some apps have simply buckled under the pressure.”

But this isn’t just about us. It’s about the entire tech ecosystem. It’s a question of whether startups–and small businesses of all kinds–can stand up for their rights and win. And because we focus specifically on health tech, it’s no exaggeration to say that when it comes to technologies developed by companies like ours, lives hang in the balance.

Here’s what the case is all about, in a nutshell. AliveCor pioneered electrocardiogram technologies (ECG) for smartphones and smartwatches. In 2016 we launched KardiaBand, an FDA-cleared, medical-grade wearable ECG. The responses were wonderful, with people saying it helped to transform their health and their lives. But two years later, Apple announced that it had created its own technology–and made its new watches incompatible with a central feature of KardiaBand.

Equipped with patents, scientific reports, and other evidence, we fought back. Since then, Apple has tried all sorts of maneuvers to fend us off, including bombarding us with expensive litigation. Nevertheless, we’ve been winning before the International Trade Commission (ITC). The agency’s role includes investigating and making determinations involving intellectual property (IP) rights in such cases.

The ITC found Apple to be in violation of the IP protecting our vital heart monitoring technology. As a result, the commission ultimately called for a ban on Apple importing its infringing watches into the United States. The corporate behemoth tried to get President Biden to veto that ban, but fortunately, he declined to do so.

We’re not alone in this kind of fight. Another medical technology company, Masimo, has been engaged in a similar battle, and also won before the ITC. Again, Biden refused to veto an Apple Watch import ban.

But rather than attempt to rectify its wrongs, Apple is trying to use its lobbying power to change the ITC. The company is lobbying Congress to “make some patent owners ineligible to bring complaints before the ITC,” and seeking “to influence the language of committee reports that could affect how the agency levels punishments.”

Apple is also trying another desperate, last-ditch effort. It got the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Patent Trial and Appeal Board to invalidate some of our patents, but we’re confident that our appeal will reverse that decision.

Apple is attempting to argue that an ITC ban on Apple Watch imports would deprive people of a device that is crucial to their health. However, the commission has previously dismissed this argument as inaccurate. In fact, the opposite is true: Allowing Apple to get away with continued infringement will kill innovation and endanger people’s health.

Health tech startups rely on investor funding to save lives. People are willing to invest in these new ideas because they expect that some will succeed, so they’ll recoup their investments and see a future payoff.

If large corporations can simply copy these technologies, then investors will lose the confidence and incentive to provide funding at various stages. Investors and small business leaders need to know that the rules fairly and reliably protect the Davids in the same way that they protect the Goliaths.

Our battle against Apple has always taken place on an uneven field. The intervention of Congress on Apple’s behalf would make things even worse. President Biden stood up to Apple’s bullying tactics–and Congress should do the same.

Apple's 2024 has been a struggle so far, as deteriorating data points have cut into its market performance. But according to JPMorgan, it isn't deterring enthusiasm among hedge fund investors, who are holding out for future upside.

The reasons? An AI-led iPhone upgrade cycle, and a moderating valuation premium, the bank outlined.

These same factors are behind JPMorgan's own bullishness, holding a price target of $210 per share. That represents a 25% gain from current levels, with Apple trading at $168.71 as of 9:20 a.m. ET.

First, rising investor appetite for Apple is chiefly coming from expectations of an AI-driven boost, similar to how the 5G upgrades helped shares skyrocket in 2020.

As with 5G, the introduction of on-device AI upgrades would likely ramp up the phone replacement cycle for 2 to 3 years, as the technology is expected to be only available on newer generation phones, JPMorgan said.

The bank expects iPhone 17 to be Apple's first ""AI phone,"" scheduled to come out September 2025.Due to this, JPMorgan anticipates 2026 iPhone volumes to accelerate to 240 million units.

""The product cycle will drive an inflection in the revenue and earnings growth in our estimate to 14% and 21% in FY26, respectively, relative to expectations for more muted outcomes in FY24 and FY25,"" the note said.

This puts JPMorgan's earnings forecast 7% ahead of consensus.

Advertisement

Second, the fact that Apple has slid 13.3% year-to-date means that it's now trading at the lower end of a range of multiples, as seen during the 5G cycle momentum.

""Contrary to the deterioration of fundamentals relative to both Hardware demand as well as outlook for Services growth, the interest in AAPL shares have improved from the broader group of investors who have otherwise been averse to the premium valuation multiple despite one of the lowest growth outlooks relative to the other Mega Cap Tech stocks,"" JPMorgan wrote.

Despite increased 2026 estimates, the bank continues to expect downside risks in the near-term for Apple. The company has been burdened by competitive pressures out of China and increasing regulatory scrutiny."

Wall Street is once again underestimating the earnings potential of Apple, and that should lead to significant upside for the stock price going forward, according to a Thursday note from Bank of America.

It's been a tough go of it for Apple so far this year, with the stock down 9% as investors grow increasingly concerned about where future growth will come from. But Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said Apple has plenty of levers to pull when it comes to boosting its profits above expectations.

""We see upside from vertical integration and mix on the product side that could account for over 100bps of GM upside,"" Mohan said.

And on the services side, Mohan sees another 100 basis points of potential growth margin upside ""driven by lower cost delivery from AAPL-based datacenters and silicon.""

In other words, Apple's use of in-house designed chips and reducing its reliance on public cloud providers should drive significant cost savings.

Altogether, those estimates suggest that Apple could considerably surprise Wall Street to the upside where it matters most: profit growth.

A similar scenario played out in 2018, according to the bank, when Wall Street estimated Apple's profit margins would hit 39% in 2023. It turned out Apple's profit margins were materially higher, coming in at 44% in 2023.

""In our opinion, the Street continues to underestimate the long-term gross margin potential for Apple across both products and Services yet again, where we see about 180bps of Product gross margin upside and about 150bps of Services margins upside over the next few years,"" Mohan said.

Part of the Services upside could come from Apple's highly anticipated introduction of an iPhone with Generative AI capabilities, according to Mohan, while profit upside on the product side could come from higher iPhone prices as consumers continue to favor the more expensive ""Pro"" iPhone models.

Bank of America reiterated its ""Buy"" rating and $225 price target in a note on Thursday, representing potential upside of 28% from Thursday's close."

It looks like Apple investors will jump at any sign of good news on the AI front after the company's rough start to the year.

On Thursday, Apple rose more than 4% after Bloomberg reported that it will overhaul its Mac lineup with new M4 processors focused on AI.

It was the best day for Apple's stock since May and a welcome boost after a number of setbacks this year have weighed on the shares. It's also a sign that investors are watching very eagerly for even the smallest signal that Apple is taking steps toward an AI-led future."

Apple is working to a fix a bug in its latest iOS software that suggests the Palestinian flag emoji when some users search for the word “Jerusalem” in the emoji keyboard.

The company told CNN it is aware of a bug within predictive emoji in the keyboard and is working on a fix that will be made available in the next iOS update.

Apple’s latest software, iOS 17.4.1, was introduced on March 21, but the recent discovery of the bug upset some users on social media. In one post on X viewed more than 2.3 million times, an iPhone user questioned whether Apple was aware of the error – and whether it was intentional. Apple said the issue was a mistake and not coded into the keyboard intentionally.

But the user, who said she was Jewish, provided a long list of other cities that don’t surface a flag when entered into the emoji search box.

It’s possible Apple’s machine-learning technology determined the suggested emoji based on analyzing texts from millions of its users. Apple declined to elaborate on the cause.

The company did not share when the next update would become available.

The history of the region is complicated, and territorial claims in the ancient city are no less so. In 1967, Israel captured East Jerusalem along with other regions and later annexed that as part of Jerusalem to unify the city as its capital – although much of the international community recognizes East Jerusalem as Israel-occupied Palestinian territory. For its part, Israel considers Jerusalem as its undivided capital. In 2017, the US administration of President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, reversing decades of American foreign policy.

So suggesting a Palestinian flag emoji for the search query “Jerusalem,” particularly when Israel is at war with Hamas, is adding to tensions amid a long-running dispute."

The iPhone maker delivered 50.1 million units in the first quarter of 2024, a 9.6% year-on-year drop, according to a report from research firm IDC. The fall puts Apple behind Korea’s Samsung, which sold 60.1 million units.

The troublesome market for Apple? China. Chinese consumers are turning away from Apple’s latest iPhone and instead buying from local champions like Xiaomi and Huawei. “Increased competition in China is a big part of Apple’s decline in Q1,” Nabila Popal, a research director for IDC’s worldwide tracker team, told Bloomberg.

Apple now has 17.3% of the global market. By comparison, Samsung has 20.8% market share; the Korean company’s first-quarter shipments dropped by 0.7% year on year.

Three Chinese smartphone manufacturers—Xiaomi, Transsion, and Oppo—round out the top five. Together, the three firms shipped 94.5 million units with a combined market share of 32.7%. IDC estimated that Transsion, a budget-focused brand that’s found success in emerging markets, shipped 85% more phones this quarter than a year ago.

Apple’s decline comes even as the overall smartphone market recovers from a post-COVID slump. Smartphone sales rose 7.8% to reach 289.4 million units, according to IDC. “Smartphone recovery continues to move forward with market optimism slowly building among the top brands,” Ryan Reith, IDC’s group vice president for worldwide mobility and consumer device trackers, said in a statement.

Apple’s China problems

Apple reported a 13% year-on-year drop in its sales in China, one of its most important non-U.S markets, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, even as global iPhone sales rose 6%.

Apple will report its next quarterly earnings, including China sales, in early May. But independent research reports that the company’s slump is extending into 2024. iPhone sales in China dropped by 24% in the first six weeks of the year compared with the same period a year earlier, according to a March report from Counterpoint Research.

China’s smartphone market is shrinking amid the country’s broader slump in consumer confidence. Counterpoint Research estimated earlier this year that overall phone shipments in China dropped by 7% in the first six weeks of the year.

Chinese consumers have been slow to embrace Apple’s new iPhone 15, with both Apple and third-party resellers offering discounts just a few months after the model’s release. “Consumers feel fine holding on to the older-generation iPhones for now,” Mengmeng Zhang, a senior analyst with Counterpoint, said at the time.

Apple is also facing regulatory scrutiny from the Chinese government. Last year, Beijing reportedly banned use of the iPhone by government officials as part of a wider drive for tech self-sufficiency. (Also in Beijing’s crosshairs: Microsoft Windows and Intel processors.)

Renewed China competition

Yet Apple also faces a more crowded Chinese market.

One major competitor is Huawei. The Chinese tech giant’s phone sales rose 64% in the first six weeks of 2024, according to Counterpoint. Huawei returned to the premium smartphone market last year with the Mate 60 Pro, a 5G smartphone featuring a homegrown processor.

Other brands, like Honor—born from Huawei’s decision to spin off its budget smartphone division in the wake of U.S. sanctions—are also acquiring market share as they expand into more expensive handhelds.

Xiaomi—the world’s third-largest seller of smartphones, according to IDC—is meanwhile entering a sector that Apple abandoned: electric cars. Earlier this year, the Chinese smartphone maker launched its first EV, the SU7. The model racked up 120,000 orders in 36 hours, and Xiaomi is warning that the wait list may extend to more than half a year."

Nearly half of the Omaha-headquartered holding company's $364 billion portfolio—42.9 percent—is invested in Apple, with Berkshire Hathaway currently owning a 5.9 percent stake in the tech company.

After the Vanguard Group, Berkshire Hathaway is Apple's biggest backer. Buffett's company also has holdings in both Visa and Mastercard, though combined they make up less than 1 percent of its total assets, as reported by The Motley Fool in December. A modest 0.5 percent of Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio rests in Amazon.

These four companies have all been served antitrust lawsuits by the Biden administration, as the government has focused on empowering U.S. competition authorities to counteract the growing influence of a handful of companies on the country's market.

Last month, the Justice Department and 16 other state and district attorneys general said they were suing Apple for monopolization or attempted monopolization of smartphone markets in violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act. In September last year, the Federal Trade Commission and 17 state attorneys general sued Amazon for its ""ongoing pattern of illegal conduct"" to block competition.

Visa and Mastercard reached a $30 billion settlement with U.S. merchants in March over a long-running antitrust suit alleging the two credit card companies were conspiring to overcharge the Square payment platform, raising retail prices for consumers in return. The settlement, under which the two companies agree to reduce intercharge fees, still needs to receive court approval.

Steve H. Hanke, a Professor of Applied Economics at The Johns Hopkins University who served on President Ronald Reagan's Council of Economic Advisers, told Newsweek that the Biden administration's antitrust policies can be considered inspired by the New Brandeis movement.

This is a school of thought that opposes the idea that modern antitrust law should focus on customer welfare, advocating instead for a broader anti-monopoly approach concerned with private power and the promotion of competition in the market.

""The President has appointed a 'neo-Brandeisian troika' of Tim Wu (Special Adviser, Competition and Technology Policy), Lina Khan (FTC Chair), and Jonathan Kanter (Asst AG, DoJ Antitrust Division),"" Hanke said.

""The 'troika' takes a very simplistic antitrust perspective that, in short, 'big is bad,' he continued, adding that the Biden administration ""seems to ignore the fact that many firms become big because they serve customers with what they want, and do so more effectively than their rivals do.""

Wu, Khan and Kanter have focused on ""fighting proposed mergers and revising or ignoring previous merger guidelines,"" Hanke said. ""As time goes on, I believe the 'troika' will focus more on so-called 'anti-competitive practices,' and are likely to attempt to regulate the behavior of outfits like Visa, Mastercard, and Apple more tightly.""

Should these efforts prevail, he said, ""they will blunt the success of those companies that are more tightly regulated, and harm their shareholders, including Berkshire Hathaway.""

But other experts think the consequences of the antitrust lawsuit on investors might be much less significant. Yuri Khodjamirian, CFA, Chief Investment Officer at Tema ETFs, told Newsweek that Visa and Mastercard have so far navigated the scrutiny of regulators successfully, while they believe the case against Apple is ""weak.""

Read more: Compare the Best Growth Stocks

""Our view in general is that Visa and Mastercard have navigated the landscape well and weathered caps on various fees,"" Khodjamirian said. ""These have not prevented growth continuing in both operations. The reality is that these payment networks collect a very small charge with the majority of interchange going to the issuing and accepting banks. This creates a stable system. Hence we think these sorts of regulatory actions are absolutely a risk but they are unlikely to break up the existing system.""

When it comes to the Department of Justice's case against Apple, Khodjamirian said regulators will have to prove that customers of iPhones and developers both suffered because of Apple's monopoly power over the iPhone.

""This simply isn't the case, as both highly value the platform that Apple has created,"" he said. ""We think Apple will agree to certain changes, for example opening up access to make phones more interoperable with other possible payments systems,"" he continued. ""These trials also last a very long time. The key for markets is surprises and we don't think there was anything bad in the DOJ documents.""

Ultimately, Khodjamirian believes that Buffett's portfolio is likely to be unaffected by the lawsuits, ""with a small risk that further pressure continues."""

During his visit, he's set to meet with content creators, app developers, and students to learn about how they use Apple products, according to local media.

Apple also plans to boost its ties with local suppliers during the trip as well as help fund clean water projects and education opportunities, local newspaper VietnamNet wrote.

In this exclusive featurette provided by Apple TV+ first to Newsweek, Douglas can be seen talking about the importance of the project.

""Ben Franklin, he was a rock star around the world, but he was also successful at diplomacy,"" Douglas says in the featurette. ""So here he was at 70-years-old being asked to go over to France with his grandson and get their help to develop our democracy.""

The limited series, also executive produced by Douglas, follows Franklin on a secret mission to France to persuade the government to support American independence from England. Considered the first American Diplomat by the U.S. State Department, Franklin's efforts in France led to the government providing vital resources which ultimately helped the United States win the American Revolution.

""If Ben Franklin did not succeed, we would not have America. That's the bottom line,"" Douglas says.

The limited series is based on the biography A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America by Stacy Schiff and was shot partially on location in and around Versailles, France.

""The secret of a good period show is to make historical figures like real people,"" Douglas says.

And one of the ways we see a side of Franklin we've never seen before is in the portrayal of his relationship with his grandson, Temple Franklin (played by Noah Jupe). It's both real, genuine, and playful, qualities rarely seen in historical dramas.

Michael Douglas in ""Franklin,"" now streaming on Apple TV+. Michael Douglas in ""Franklin,"" now streaming on Apple TV+. Apple TV+

""Benjamin Franklin stepped into that father figure role,"" Jupe says in the featurette, and that's apparent throughout the series.

Another aspect of Franklin that is different than other Revolutionary War-era historical dramas is the vibrancy of the surroundings, both in color and in scope. It shows France at the height of its power, with the costumes and set design depicting the opulence of the era.

Ultimately Douglas hopes Franklin will inspire viewers to be more patriotic about democracy at the heart of the American experience.

""You become very patriotic when you do a show like this. Hopefully it'll remind us how proud we are to be in a democracy...It's an ideal we have to support and desperately protect,"" Douglas says.

Nwokorie, its newly crowned brand head and a former senior director at Apple Inc., will succeed Kenny Wilson after the current year ends in March 2025, the company said in a separate statement.

Two months ago, Tim Cook was busy marking Apple's bold new vision of the future with the launch of expensive nerd goggles. He might want to reconsider where the company's real future lies.

Last week, investors signaled their belief that there is a more important needle-mover in the Cupertino giant's future than the $3,500 Vision Pro headset it launched in February; Apple's stock by $112 billion after news of an AI overhaul to Macs, of all things.

A report on Thursday from Bloomberg's Mark Gurman said Apple is working on revamping its entire Mac lineup with a series of new M4 processors that aim to put AI at their center.

The positive response to the news shows two key things for Apple.

First, expectations are sky-high for its AI strategy.

Though Apple has remained mostly silent on its plans for the tech industry's most-discussed technology over the past year, the market expects Apple's AI efforts to help bring new life to product categories that have felt increasingly staid in recent years.

Related stories

Macs, which suffered a 27% sales drop in the last fiscal year, could entice a new generation of buyers if they come fitted with chips that power generative AI features.

The same goes for iPhones — Apple's biggest revenue driver — at a time when their sales are showing signs of weakness. A report from the International Data Corporation published Monday showed iPhone sales dropped almost 10% in the first quarter of the year.

During that period, Apple particularly struggled with selling iPhones in China, its most important international market, as competitors like Huawei enticed consumers to rival offerings like the Mate 60 Pro. AI could give the phones the refresh needed to make them more appealing again.

Second, the future of the Vision Pro remains highly uncertain.

Mixed-reality technologies like virtual and augmented reality remain niche areas, which are proving tough to attract a mass consumer market to. Some early adopters have already returned their headsets. Apple, meanwhile, has already started offering discounts, per reports.

Also, as my colleague Peter Kafka noted this month, the Vision Pro lacks ""killer apps"" that can make its ""spatial computing"" concept feel like more than just a neat trick with a limited number of use cases.

Will that change any time soon? It's possible. With Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference set for June, a slate of announcements linked to the Vision Pro could make it much more useful.

Economic data gave Beijing a glimmer of hope on Tuesday — but beneath the veneer of China's quarterly GDP numbers, there are still plenty of reasons for concern.

The world's second-largest economy expanded by 5.3% over the first three months of the year compared with the same period last year, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. That's higher than the 4.8% figure analysts polled by Bloomberg were expecting.

Cook made his comments while meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh, according to state media outlet Voice of Vietnam. Apple also said that it would increase its spending on suppliers, according to a press release on Monday.

“There is no place like Vietnam, a vibrant and beautiful country,” said Cook, according to the press release, adding that the company’s annual spending in the country had doubled since 2019.

No details were shared about the plan. Cook arrived in Hanoi on Monday for a two-day visit during which he met students, programmers and content creators.

Apple began operating in Vietnam over a decade ago, and says it is responsible for creating over 200,000 jobs there. Vietnam is also among the top five leading mobile game producers globally.

Apple has 26 suppliers with 28 factories in Vietnam, according to its 2022 list. Most of these located in northern provinces, where they can be easily connected to existing supply chains in southern China. Northern Vietnam has also historically been a hub for making electronics and has cheap, skilled labor."

The vibes on Apple's Vision Pro are mixed, at best: People like the tech but aren't sure why they should use it, which is a problem for a device that sells for $3,500 and up.

But what about high-tech goggles that don't cost that much, and do have things you can do with them — like play games?

Well, those have issues, too. On the one hand, people are buying them: As of 2023, Meta had sold more than 20 million of its Quest headsets, which start at around $500. But they're not using them that much.

Apple is no longer the undisputed top dog of the smartphone world.

So who are Apple's biggest rivals and the rising threats trying to eat its lunch?

Global shipments of iPhones contracted nearly 10% in the first quarter of the year, according to a recent report from International Data Corporation, a market research firm.

The factory’s closure led to a shortage of some 6 million iPhones, according to Bank of America.

After that incident Apple began pushing to move its supply chain to other countries in the region.

Now it seems to have earmarked Vietnam as one of the countries where it will ramp up operations. Apple already makes several products in Vietnam, including AirPods and Apple Watches. In December, Apple moved some iPad manufacturing from China to Vietnam. Some of Apple’s key suppliers, like Foxconn, which is based in Taiwan, and Luxshare, which makes iPhones and the recently released Apple Vision Pro headset, have also been opting to bolster their supply chains in Vietnam. Since 2019, Apple has invested $16 billion in manufacturing capabilities in the country, according to state media.

Apple’s shift mirrors the U.S. as a whole, as the nation reevaluates its trade relationship with China over what it considers to be unfair business practices. While Cook was in Vietnam this week, President Joe Biden hosted other Asian leaders at the White House, promising closer ties amid rising geopolitical tensions across the world.

Trade relations between the U.S. and China have become increasingly tense over the past year, and the resulting uncertainty has made the prospect of relying so heavily on China less palatable. Both countries have traded pointed public statements and implemented trade policies designed to hobble each other. The advent of AI, combined with a global chip shortage, led to a U.S. government ban on Chinese firms’ accessing the most advanced semiconductor technology. More recently, the U.S. and other countries in Asia and Europe have accused China of oversupplying certain sectors of the market with cheap goods meant to undercut international competitors.

All this comes against a backdrop of declining sales for Apple in China. By mid-February iPhone sales in China were down 24% compared with the same time a year prior as Chinese smartphones eat away at Apple’s market share. In the first quarter of this year, iPhone shipments dropped 10%, as the Cupertino giant lost its spot to Samsung as the No. 1 smartphone in the world."

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) — Apple CEO Tim Cook said the company will “look at” manufacturing in Indonesia as he met with Indonesian President Joko Widodo on Wednesday.

Widodo’s administration has worked for years to bring manufacturing to the country to power economic development, while Apple is seeking to diversify its supply chains away from China, where most of its smartphones and tablets are assembled.

The company began moving some production to countries like Vietnam, and more recently India, after shutdowns to fight COVID-19 in China repeatedly disrupted the company’s shipments.

“I think the investment ability in Indonesia is endless. I think that, there is a lot of great places to invest, and we’re investing. We believe in the country,” Cook said.

The previous day, Cook met Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi, where he said Apple plans to invest more in Vietnam and increase spending on suppliers in the Southeast Asian manufacturing hub.

“Given the slowing Chinese economy as well as the Chinese government’s ongoing efforts to squeeze out foreign companies and replace them with domestic brands, Apple wants alternatives for manufacturing,” said Chris Miller, an associate professor at Tufts University whose work focuses on technology and geopolitics.

“It has already invested more in India and Vietnam, but it is likely looking at other partners in South East Asia to additional manufacturing and assembly operations,” Miller said.

Cook’s visit to Indonesia came after Apple announced its fourth Apple Developer Academy in the country, to be located in Bali. The company first launched the program to train app developers in Indonesia in 2018, in the capital Jakarta."

Just a few days ago, Apple pledged to increase investment in Vietnam, already a manufacturing hub for its products. Cook then flew further south to Indonesia—and said Wednesday that he’s ready to “look at” the country’s manufacturing sector.

After meeting Indonesia’s president, Joko Widodo, commonly referred to as Jokowi, Cook said that Apple will consider investing in an Indonesia-based supply chain, citing the president’s “desire to see manufacturing in the country.”

“The investment ability in Indonesia is endless. There’s a lot of great places to invest, and we’re investing,” Cook told reporters on Wednesday, without going into specifics.

Neither Apple nor its suppliers manufacture products in Indonesia. Apple also does not operate a store in the country.

Yet the company manages several developer academies to integrate Indonesian developers into the iOS ecosystem. On Wednesday, Apple said it would open its fourth academy on the island of Bali.

An Indonesian minister later added that the government asked the iPhone maker to open two more centers, including one in the country’s new capital on the island of Borneo, named Nusantara.

Indonesia requires that smartphones sold in the country are made up of at least 35% local components by value; Apple’s phones satisfy the quota as a result of the company’s investment in local software development.

Jokowi, who will leave office later this year, tried to encourage investment in higher-value manufacturing during his tenure.

In particular, he tried to leverage the country’s large reserves of nickel, a key material used in stainless steel and electric batteries. Indonesia banned the export of raw nickel ore in early 2020, spurring Chinese and Korean refiners to invest in local refining capacity.

Chinese EV giant BYD will also invest $1.3 billion in an Indonesian factory, government officials said earlier this year.

What are Apple’s plans for Vietnam?

Cook’s Indonesia stopover follows a two-day visit to Vietnam, already a manufacturing hub for Apple and its suppliers.

During his trip, Apple pledged to increase its spending on Vietnam-based suppliers. The company said it has spent $15.7 billion on the country’s supply chain since 2019, creating about 200,000 jobs.

Apple and its suppliers already produce iPhones, iPads, Apple Watches, and MacBooks in the country. The company relies on 25 suppliers in Vietnam, up from 21 in 2020, according to Reuters.

China is Apple’s largest manufacturing hub, but the company is diversifying its supply chains following significant COVID-era disruptions to its China-based manufacturing. Lockdowns in Zhengzhou, home to Apple supplier Foxconn’s most important iPhone plant, significantly disrupted Apple’s 2022 smartphone production ahead of the holiday season.

In addition to Vietnam, Apple is expanding production in India. The company made 14% of its iPhones in the South Asian country last fiscal year, up from 7% during the preceding fiscal year, Bloomberg reported last week.

Apple is also facing a slump in China sales owing to renewed competition from domestic brands. Chinese competition helped knock Apple from its perch as the world’s top smartphone seller in the first quarter of 2024, according to a report from research firm IDC."

Apple has put Indonesia in the frame as it looks to reduce its reliance on manufacturing in China.

Apple has fixed a bug that suggested the Palestinian flag emoji when some users searched for the word “Jerusalem” in the emoji keyboard.

On Tuesday, the company addressed the bug with the latest beta software release of iOS 17.5, just a few days after it said it was working on a fix.

Apple’s previous update was introduced on March 21, but the recent discovery of the bug upset some users on social media. In one April 9 post on X viewed more than 2.3 million times, an iPhone user questioned whether Apple was aware of the error – and whether it was intentional. Apple said at the time the issue was a mistake and not coded into the keyboard intentionally.

But the user, who said she was Jewish, provided a long list of other cities that don’t surface a flag when entered into the emoji search box. It’s possible, however, Apple’s machine-learning technology determined the suggested emoji based on analyzing texts from millions of its users.

The history of the region is complicated, and territorial claims in the ancient city are no less so. In 1967, Israel captured East Jerusalem along with other regions and later annexed that as part of Jerusalem to unify the city as its capital – although much of the international community recognizes East Jerusalem as Israel-occupied Palestinian territory. For its part, Israel considers Jerusalem as its undivided capital. In 2017, the US administration of President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as Israel’s capital, reversing decades of American foreign policy.

So suggesting a Palestinian flag emoji for the search query “Jerusalem,” particularly when Israel is at war with Hamas, added tensions amid a long-running dispute."

And expert Anirudh Suri, a non-resident fellow at Washington think tank Carnegie Endowment's New Delhi office, believes Apple will continue to move its supply chain out of China.

""Moving or diversifying the manufacturing base away from China is a geopolitical imperative for companies like Apple,"" he told Newsweek. ""Their shareholders would punish them if they were to not diversify away and be caught in further geopolitical crossfires, since the U.S.-China tussle is not ending anytime soon.""

Former President Donald Trump launched a trade war with China, which has pressured Apple's traditional manufacturing base in the country. President Joe Biden has imposed further technological restrictions on Chinese companies, entrenching the geopolitical competition with Beijing.

Though Washington has said it doesn't want to completely decouple the technology supply chains from China, it has sought to reduce interdependence in sectors such as semiconductors, artificial intelligence, and telecommunications. Driven by national security concerns, the U.S. has imposed export restrictions and investment limits, while China is accelerating its domestic technological advancements.

But geopolitics isn't the only factor forcing Apple to look elsewhere. It subcontracts manufacturing of its products to companies such as Taiwan's Foxconn, an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM), that makes iPhones, Macbooks, and other Apple products.

For the last two decades, Apple has partnered with Foxconn in China, but the cost of these products has increased in recent years. So profitability is another pressure, on top of geopolitics, which is pushing Apple to seek new manufacturing locations.

And the Indian government has been quick to exploit the opportunity.

New Delhi is offering lucrative programs to attract companies such as Apple, including the Production Linked Incentive Scheme, a $26 billion golden carrot for companies in 14 sectors, according to India's Ministry of Commerce and Industry.

Newsweek contacted China's Ministry of Commerce, India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, and Apple and Foxconn for comments via email.

Apple's investments in India have started yielding results as the export of its products from the country is on the rise.

""Apple's iPhone exports from India almost doubled to $12.1 billion in 2023-24 from $6.27 billion in the preceding fiscal,"" Indian news agency Press Trust of India reported on Tuesday, citing data by data firm The Trade Vision.

""India is making a big push for expanding its manufacturing base, and companies such as Apple do want to have a foot in the door,"" Suri added. ""Political stability, state-level manufacturing incentives (states like Tamil Nadu have aggressively courted companies like Apple), and the availability of a skilled workforce add to the attraction.

""Of course, Apple doesn't want to put all its eggs in one basket (e.g., Vietnam), so adding a base like India makes sense.""

China accounts for 20 percent of Apple's sales globally, making it one of the biggest consumers of Apple products. However, Apple sales in China are declining as local consumers shift towards domestic mobile brands.

Apple reported a 13 percent year-on-year drop in its sales in China for the December quarter, as revenue in the Greater China region, including Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, fell to $20.8 billion, according to Hong Kong Newspaper South China Morning Post on February 2."

Apple is planning to buy more components from Vietnam, underscoring a trend among global tech firms to look beyond China to secure their supply chains, cut costs and open up new markets.

CEO Tim Cook made the pledge in a meeting with Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh in Hanoi Tuesday, according to a statement by Vietnam’s government.

Apple (AAPL) has already spent almost $16 billion through its supply chain in the country since 2019, the government quoted Cook as saying. And the company has created more than 200,000 jobs in Vietnam, it added.

According to the statement, Cook said Apple “stands ready … to enhance cooperation and investment activities” in the Southeast Asian country.

His visit highlights Vietnam’s growing importance to global companies looking for alternatives to China as trade tensions between Beijing and the West have escalated in recent years.

Vietnam has been a “major beneficiary” of moves by multinational companies to diversify their manufacturing hubs — a strategy known as “China plus one” — says Thuy Anh Nguyen, a strategist at Dragon Capital, a local fund management firm that invests solely in Vietnamese companies.

Nguyen, whose firm manages $6 billion in assets, told CNN that labor costs in Vietnam’s manufacturing sector are about half those in neighboring China.

That has helped Vietnam go from producing mostly “low-value products” like textiles to more tech products like iPhones and iPads, she said. “Those are higher-value items. That’s how we move up the value chain.”

Vietnam pulled in more than $4.29 billion in foreign direct investment during the first two months of the year, up almost 39% from the same period in 2023, according to the country’s Ministry of Planning and Investment. Most of the new investment went into the processing and manufacturing sector.

A ‘perfect landing spot’

In recent years, fast-growing Asian economies like Vietnam and India have emerged as alternative locations for manufacturers as ties between Beijing and the West have frayed.

Vietnam is “the perfect landing spot for tech companies to diversify outside China,” according to Dan Ives, a senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, who pointed to the high number of trained engineers in the country as one factor.

“We’re not just talking about (manufacturing of) low-cost electronics,” he told CNN. “We’re talking higher up the value chain… That was not even on the radar (of foreign companies) two years ago.”

Once enemies in war, the United States and Vietnam have grown increasingly close — the value of US imports of Vietnamese goods s﻿oared more than 360% in the decade to end-2023 to top $144 billion, according to US government data.

In September, the two countries formally upgraded their diplomatic ties to a “comprehensive strategic partnership,” a symbolic yet highly important move that positions Vietnam as a destination for more US investment, including for critical technologies like semiconductor chips.

Intel (INTC) has also taken note of Vietnam’s rise. In 2021, the company committed $1.5 billion to a sprawling campus just outside Ho Chi Minh City, which it says will be its largest single assembly and test facility in the world.

At the same time, relations between the United States and China have deteriorated. A trade war between the two countries, which began in 2018 when Washington slapped tariffs on many Chinese imports, ratcheted up last year as both sides introduced tit-for-tat chipmaking export controls.

During the pandemic, meanwhile, China’s strict zero-Covid policy scrambled global supply chains, demonstrating the risks of concentrating production in a single location.

Notably, the world’s biggest iPhone factory, located in central China and owned by Taiwanese manufacturing firm Foxconn, was forced to temporarily shut down in 2022 after workers revolted over fears of the spread of coronavirus.

Consumer market

Vietnam has another advantage, says Nguyen: A booming, educated, and youthful population. That’s a big draw for foreign tech companies looking to hire workers for their factories, and find consumers for their products.

“Vietnam has a population of 100 million people. If it was in Europe, it would be the biggest country,” she said, also noting that smartphone adoption in Vietnam was rapidly increasing.

The International Monetary Fund expects Vietnam’s economy to growth 5.8% this year, much faster than the predicted global average of 3.2%. For 2025, the fund forecasts growth of 6.5% in Vietnam. That’s not far off India’s pace of expansion.

Still, Vietnam represents a far smaller market than India, which has also been wooing large foreign companies, including Tesla (TSLA), to set up factories in the country.

For now, Vietnam’s attractiveness to foreign firms is “more around supply than demand,” says Ives at Wedbush Securities, while, for India, it encompasses both.

China is an important manufacturing and consumer market for Apple. CEO Tim Cook visited the country last month to open a new store in Shanghai and rub elbows with top policymakers. That visit came after iPhone sales dropped earlier this year. And in January, Chinese chipmakers drew up plans to create chip production lines to supply processors to local smartphone makers. The move stands to hurt Apple, which has so far benefited from tight export restrictions.

China's direction to Apple comes as US policymakers debate a ban on TikTok, the popular Chinese app. Some lawmakers are concerned about data harvesting and political influence. The bill would prevent Apple and Google from distributing TikTok's app in their app stores and ban US websites from hosting TikTok."

The iPhone maker also removed the messaging services Telegram and Signal, according to consultants tracking the space. Apple, which has consistently complied with one of the world’s most rigid internet censorship regimes, said the Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the apps removed over national security concerns.

The orders come on the heels of a cleanup program Chinese regulators initiated in 2023 that was expected to remove many defunct or unregistered apps from domestic iOS and Android stores, including local ones. In August, China asked all mobile app developers to register with the government by the end of March, or cease operating.

Beijing has barred the use of foreign messaging and social media platforms like WhatsApp for years, using what the industry calls the Great Firewall. That’s helped apps like Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat dominate domestic usage, though Chinese users can still employ virtual private networks to view foreign media.

Less sensitive apps with more substantial Chinese businesses such as Duolingo are expected to comply with the latest regulatory licensing regime to remain operational, said Rich Bishop, co-founder and chief executive officer of AppInChina.

“It will mean that Chinese consumers are pretty much limited to just Chinese apps, with a small number of international ones,” said Bishop, whose consultancy has received dozens of inquiries from companies about how to stay compliant and publish software in China. “That’s quite a big change — so it will further cut off Chinese citizens from the rest of the world in a sense.”

The action against the American tech services comes as the U.S. government is taking steps toward a ban on TikTok, the hit video app from Beijing-based ByteDance Ltd. U.S. politicians have also cited national security concerns in their push to force the company to either sell TikTok to a non-Chinese owner or face a ban in the U.S. market.

“We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree. The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,” Apple said in a statement. “These apps remain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.”

The app registration process kicked off last year in what Beijing painted as a bid to counter telephone scams and fraud. The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said that it would carry out supervision work on those filings from April to June, and to take action against unregistered apps. Developers would also be required to set up and improve mechanisms to handle “illegal information.”

The MIIT move was regarded as another step by Beijing to tighten controls across its cyberspace, forcing internet companies to scrub information considered politically sensitive. Beyond apps, websites and large language AI models have also been subject to greater content curbs.

The Wall Street Journal was first to report the app removal. A Meta spokesperson referred Bloomberg News to Apple’s statement. Representatives for Telegram and Signal didn’t respond to requests for comment.

China’s action comes as TikTok divestiture legislation is expected to be included in a fast-moving aid package for Ukraine and Israel that Congress is expected to vote on this Saturday.

China is a key nation for the iPhone, its largest consumer market outside the U.S. and its primary production base. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook visited the country earlier this year and emphasized its importance to his business. Apple has long said that it needs to follow local laws as part of operating its app store effectively in different countries."

Hong Kong CNN —

Apple has removed WhatsApp and Threads from its app store in China, following an order from the country’s internet watchdog which cited national security concerns.

“We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,” an Apple spokesperson told CNN on Friday. “The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns. These apps remain available for download on all other storefronts where they appear.”

The apps, both owned by Meta (META), were already blocked in China and not widely used. They could be accessed in the country only by using virtual private networks (VPNs) that can encrypt internet traffic and disguise the user’s online identity.

The removal of the apps by Apple (AAPL) represents a “further distancing between already separated tech universes” in the country and beyond, said Duncan Clark, chairman of Beijing-based investment advisory BDA China.

“It will cause inconvenience to consumers and businesses (in China) who deal with family, friends or customers overseas. Even if they use VPNs to access their existing WhatsApp apps, these over time will become obsolete and require updating,” he said.

Other popular Western social media apps including X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Instagram and Messenger are still available on Apple’s China app store, according to a check by CNN.

The tech giant’s announcement comes against a backdrop of plunging iPhone sales in the world’s second largest economy. Its smartphone sales tumbled a stunning 10% in the first quarter of this year, according to market research firm IDC.

The company has lost momentum in China as nationalism, a rough economy and increased competition have hurt Apple over the past several months.

The resurgence of Huawei and other Chinese brands, including Xiaomi and OPPO/OnePlus, will likely continue, according to IDC. Chinese consumers who once would have considered Apple are now turning to the country’s national brands.

Besides being a key production center, China remains an important market for Apple as it is the largest market behind the United States. The company continues to offer discounts in the country to help boost sales.

Its CEO Tim Cook visited Shanghai just last month to open the second biggest Apple store in the world.

Tim Cook would like you to think everything is going swimmingly for Apple in China.

A highlight reel of the Apple CEO's recent trip to the country, posted to his Weibo account, showed him being papped by fans at the opening of a new store in Shanghai's Jing'an district, taking selfies on an iPhone with celebrity models, and casually strolling the historic Bund.

This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

""Every time I am in China, I can feel the unique charm here again. Thank you very much for the warm reception!"" Cook wrote in the social media post.

Here's the thing. The Apple chief actually had a major dilemma facing him in China at the time he posted the video last month: iPhone sales were down by an alarming 24% in the first six weeks of the year, per data from Counterpoint Research.

And despite the charm offensive from Cook, there's a risk that downward spiral is about to get a whole lot worse.

On Thursday, Huawei released a new series of smartphones called the Pura 70. They come fitted with an advanced new camera system that looks similar to the trio of lenses on the back of the iPhone Pro models, and starts at $760.

Critically, the new phones give Huawei a fresh opportunity to take a bigger bite out of Apple's share of the China smartphone market. It's already won over some consumers since launching the Mate 60 Pro series last year.

The Mate 60 raised some fears in the US last year after the discovery that they were being powered by advanced chips that Washington had sought to prevent China obtaining by imposing tight export controls.

Those chips, made domestically, helped Huawei make huge gains in China by enabling features that rival those seen in iPhones. They're now believed to be in the new Pura 70 devices too, per Reuters, which spoke to a customer who tested their network speed.

Counterpoint estimated a 64% surge in smartphone sales for Huawei in the first six weeks of the year. The Pura 70 could continue that momentum. Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint, told Reuters he thinks Huawei could almost double phone shipments this year to 60 million units.

This is not the sort of thing Apple wants to hear, of course.

China has been its most important international market for several years, but that's under threat from the rise of domestic rivals that can entice Chinese consumers with devices that look and feel nearly identical to iPhones.

Apple has already shown weakness in the face of domestic competition in China. Net sales in the Greater China region were $20.8 billion in the final three months of last year, down from $23.9 billion in the same period of 2022.

Wedbush analysts wrote last week that Apple is ""navigating one of the more difficult China demand environments we have seen the last five years."" They expect another decline in iPhone sales in the region in Apple's quarterly earnings on May 2.

Cook might be putting on a brave face, but iPhone sales in China may keep sliding if Huawei has its way."

The world’s second-largest economy is one of Apple’s most important overseas markets, and a massive manufacturing hub. “There’s no supply chain in the world that’s more critical to us than China,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said on a trip to China in March. But with China sales slumping and possible threats to its supply chain, Apple could be taking a closer look at new Asian markets.

Apple’s CEO just wrapped up a five-day tour of Southeast Asia, stopping by Vietnam, Indonesia, and Singapore on a trip that could be an effort by the company to “hedge its supply-chain bets” and “ease the path” for later investment in the fast-growing region.

Southeast Asia is one of several emerging markets, alongside India and Latin America, that Apple needs to target for future growth, says Ivan Lam, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.

“Apple’s brand image is perceived as high-end in the Southeast Asian region and holds a favorable position in consumers’ mindsets,” he says. The analyst anticipates “further enhancement” in Apple’s sales strategies for Southeast Asia as the region’s consumption levels improve.

Southeast Asia, for now, makes up a small, but fast-growing, percentage of the iPhone market.

“Apple shipped just under 10 million iPhones per year to Southeast Asia last year, which accounted for less than 5% of global iPhone shipments. But that was still 32% growth for iPhones in Southeast Asia,” says Bryan Ma, vice president of client devices research at IDC.

But Ma suspects that Cook’s interest in Southeast Asia is driven not by retail, but manufacturing.

“I suspect that an even bigger motivation behind the visit, though, is for the company to hedge its supply-chain bets as the industry continues to diversify from China. That means not just meetings with suppliers who have operations in the region, but also with governments who can ease the path for investments in their countries later,” Ma said.

China is still Apple’s largest manufacturing hub, but the COVID pandemic demonstrated to the iPhone maker the risk of having everything in one place. COVID lockdowns in Zhengzhou, sometimes known as “iPhone City,” lowered Apple’s smartphone production in 2022. Apple later partly blamed COVID disruptions for a 5% year-on-year drop in revenue for the 2022 holiday quarter.

More broadly, the U.S. is encouraging companies to “de-risk” by diversifying supply chains away from China.

Where did Apple CEO Tim Cook visit in Southeast Asia?

Cook’s first stop was Vietnam, already part of Apple’s supply chain. The country boasts a typical export-oriented manufacturing economy, and can leverage its close proximity to existing manufacturing supply chains in China.

During his two-day stay in Vietnam, Cook pledged to increase spending on Vietnam-based suppliers during a meeting with Pham Minh Chinh, the country’s prime minister, in Hanoi. The company says it’s already spent close to $16 billion on the country’s supply chain since 2019, creating about 200,000 jobs.

Cook then traveled to Indonesia, Southeast Asia’s largest economy and most populous country. During a meeting with the country’s outgoing president, Joko Widodo, Cook said he would consider setting up manufacturing facilities in the country.

Apple currently has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia. Instead, the company has set up several app developer academies since 2018. Apple said it would open its fourth developer academy in Bali during Cook’s visit.

Indonesia requires smartphones sold in the country to be made up of at least 35% local components by volume, though Apple satisfies the requirement, despite the lack of local production, through its developer academies.

The government hopes the U.S. tech giant will go beyond software. Indonesia’s industry minister, who was also at the meeting with Cook and Widodo, suggested after the meeting that Apple could partner with Indonesian companies to obtain components, even if it does not set up a manufacturing facility.

Cook’s final stop on his Southeast Asian tour was Singapore, the city-state with the region’s highest per capita income. The country is home to three of Apple’s five Southeast Asian stores. (The other two are in Thailand, and Apple is reportedly considering its first store in Malaysia.)

Upon Cook’s arrival, Apple announced that it would invest over $250 million to grow its campus in the city-state. Apple opened its first facility in 1981, with 72 employees focused on the Apple II personal computer. The company says it now uses Singapore as a regional hub for critical roles and currently employs over 3,600 staff.

Apple’s CEO met Singapore’s prime minister-to-be, Lawrence Wong, on Friday. On LinkedIn, Wong wrote that he discussed “opportunities in Southeast Asia” and “the close partnership between Singapore and Apple” in his meeting with Cook.

On a popular Singaporean radio show on Friday, Cook said he wanted to invest more in R&D in the country. “Singapore has always held a special place in my heart,” he told listeners."

The U.S. has threatened to ban TikTok over national security concerns. But while TikTok, owned by Chinese technology firm ByteDance, is used by millions in the U.S., apps like WhatsApp and Threads are not commonly used in China.

Instead, the messaging app WeChat, owned by Chinese company Tencent, reigns supreme.

Other Meta apps, including Facebook, Instagram and Messenger remained available for download, although use of such foreign apps is blocked in China due to its “Great Firewall” network of filters that restrict use of foreign websites such as Google and Facebook.

“The Cyberspace Administration of China ordered the removal of these apps from the China storefront based on their national security concerns,” Apple said in a statement.

“We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree,” Apple said.

A spokesman for Meta referred to “Apple for comment.”

Apple, previously the world’s top smartphone maker, recently lost the top spot to Korean rival Samsung Electronics. The U.S. firm has run into headwinds in China, one of its top three markets, with sales slumping after Chinese government agencies and employees of state-owned companies were ordered not to bring Apple devices to work."

""We are obligated to follow the laws in the countries where we operate, even when we disagree.""

Remember that quote.

It's from an unidentified Apple comms person, to The Wall Street Journal, explaining why Apple just took four messaging/social media apps — WhatsApp, Threads, Signal, and Telegram — out of its Chinese app store.

Related stories

If you follow Apple and its complicated, codependent relationship with China, you have definitely heard it, or versions of it before — like when Chinese authorities forced Apple to remove an app used by Hong Kong protesters in 2019.

You've also heard versions of it over the last few years in other countries, as big US tech companies make concessions to local rulers that would never fly in the US. Like when Netflix removed an episode of comedian Hasan Minhaj's newsy show to satisfy Saudia Arabia, or when Facebook removed posts that Turkey's government didn't like.

But now we are getting closer to hearing Apple and other tech companies use the same words to describe their actions in America.

A proposed anti-TikTok law, which has already been approved by the House, has renewed energy (TLDR: The bill may now be packaged along with measures approving aid for Ukraine and Israel, which increases the chances the Senate may pass it; Joe Biden has already said he'd sign the bill if it gets to its desk.)

If the TikTok bill does become law, it won't make TikTok go away overnight in the US.

In theory, TikTok could continue to operate in the US if ByteDance, its Chinese owner, sells it to someone else — though the Chinese government really, really doesn't want that to happen. More practically, the bill would immediately head to the US court system, where it could get tied up for a very long time.

But if the law jumps enough hurdles to become enforceable, Apple would have to remove TikTok from its US app store, as would Google.

That would be an unprecedented move in this country. But Apple has a quote ready in case it needs it."

Article content In the past, subscriber numbers have been wildly unpredictable, and the company has struggled to forecast them accurately. In 2022, Los Gatos, California-based Netflix said it would stop projecting quarterly customer data. The stock typically sees big swings the day after earnings reports. On Thursday, Netflix reported better-than-expected first-quarter results, including 9.33 million new subscribers. But the shares slumped after the company said user growth this quarter would slow and that it will stop reporting customer numbers. “Eliminating regular reporting of membership data raises questions around management’s confidence to further grow the base, though it is not implausible that the change is intended to reduce quarterly sentiment volatility around relatively small changes in true economic drivers,” Michael Morris, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities, wrote in a note to investors. Netflix isn’t the only big tech company to pull back on disclosing some metrics in order to steer investors’ focus elsewhere. In 2018, Apple said it would no longer report the number of iPhones, Macs and iPads sold each quarter, as it attempted to focus on its growing services unit. While some pundits praised the move as a way to highlight a potent new business model, others complained it was an attempt to hide the pain of a stagnant smartphone market. The shares had their worst day in four years.

Article content Last quarter, Meta said it will no longer report the number of subscribers to its family of apps, which now total almost 4 billion people who use Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp each month. The San Francisco-based company said it also won’t provide daily and monthly user numbers for its flagship Facebook app. Beginning this quarter, Meta will report year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level, while continuing to report only daily active users across its family of apps. “Fewer disclosures is a rite of passage for large tech companies namely Apple, Google, and Meta,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note. “On the other hand, removing growth disclosures signals a maturing business, and gives shareholders even fewer data points to underwrite forecasts. Time will tell how investors digest the change.” The good news for Netflix is that its decision, while angering some investors, is unlikely to have any impact on customers — its primary focus. In 2011, the company was forced to backtrack on plans to split its mail-order DVD and internet streaming services. Customers were outraged over plans to create a separate DVD offering called Qwikster, and to pay for each service separately. The company reversed the decision three weeks later.

Article content Netflix’s growth in the latest quarter was aided by a crackdown on account sharing, which pushes viewers using someone else’s password to sign up on their own at a discounted rate. The company attracted new customers from all over the world, thanks to a strong slate of original programs, showing particular strength in the US and Canada. Those new subscribers helped the company beat forecasts for sales and earnings as well. In explaining the decision to stop reporting subscriber numbers and average revenue per user, co-Chief Executive Officer Greg Peters said initiatives like the crackdown and a new ad-supported tier make those metrics less relevant. “All of that means that historical simple math that we all did, number of members times the monthly price is increasingly less accurate in capturing the state of the business,” he said in a video interview Thursday.

Apple stock is a ""top pick"" for 2024 and has potential upside of 36% as it gears up for the launch of an AI-enabled iPhone, according to Bank of America.

The bank reiterated its ""Buy"" rating and $225 price target for the company, arguing in a Monday note that much of the weakness in its expected earnings growth is already reflected in the stock.

""While we acknowledge that the demand environment is weak, we believe the stock is already reflecting this (-14% YTD) and our aggregate estimates for the year remain relatively unchanged,"" Bank of America analyst Wasmi Mohan said.

Mohan highlighted four potential catalysts that could help boost the stock from now until year-end, and they kick-off with the company's earnings call next week.

First, Mohan said he expects Apple to increase its capital return to shareholders when the company reports its fiscal second-quarter results. That could come in the form of an increased dividend, an increased stock buyback program, or both. Mohan expects a 5% dividend increase and a $90 billion stock buyback program.

Second, Mohan expects Apple to make a series of AI-related announcements at its upcoming WWDC software developers conference in June. That could excite investors, as Apple has largely been absent from announcing its AI capabilities when compared to its mega-cap tech peers.

Third, Mohan said he expects Apple to launch an AI-enabled iPhone 16 later this year that will offer on-device generative AI capabilities. That should help accelerate the company's earnings power.

""Our checks indicate that all 4 new models of iPhone this year could be launched with the same application processor (A18) that can enable improved AI/machine learning performance,"" Mohan said.

Advertisement

Finally, Mohan said that Apple's profit margins have considerable upside as the company develops chips in-house, lowering its component costs, and as it reduces its reliance on public cloud providers. Mohan also said that Apple's Services business is poised to see strong revenue growth thanks to its Licensing, App Store, iCloud, and subscription offerings like Apple TV+ and Apple Music.

For its earnings next week, Bank of America expects Apple to beat Wall Street's estimates and predicts the company will report $1 billion in revenue from sales of its Vision Pro."

Some tech devotees already seem to be losing interest in Apple's Vision Pro just months after the futuristic headset hit the market.

The long-awaited virtual-reality device prompted long lines at Apple stores and an initial surge in sales back in February, but Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported Sunday that the early buzz around the accessory had quickly waned.

That's bad news for Apple, which spent eight years and billions of dollars creating the Vision Pro. The device boasts a hefty $3,500 price tag, making it a certified specialty item and keeping it out of reach for many of Apple's typical customers.

Related stories

Gurman reported that the Vision Pro was unlikely to make the company any real money for years to come and that the number of people seeking demos for the device had dipped since February.

Apple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.

The device sold 180,000 units alone during a January preorder weekend.

Apple has seemingly responded to the growing disinterest by boosting marketing around the device, evidenced by the Vision Pro's prime placement on the company's website.

Reddit forums dedicated to the device include frustrated users complaining the device is impractical in everyday life and uncomfortable to wear. The Vision Pro requires its wearer to attach a battery, start the device, and move through its interface each use.

Gurman noted that VR devices had in the past faced similar struggles in keeping buyers interested and engaged after the novelty wore off.

BI's Jordan Hart foresaw some of those issues back in February, writing that she was running out of reasons to wear the Vision Pro after just one week.

Apple's struggles in China just keep getting worse.

It's sunk from first to third place in the Chinese smartphone market after iPhone sales tumbled 19% in the first three months of the year, according to estimates from Counterpoint Research.

The sales slump marks the iPhone's worst performance in China since 2020 and underlines increasingly tough competition from local rivals.

Chinese-based rivals Vivo and Honor outpaced Apple's sales in the first quarter of the year, per Counterpoint data. Apple finished the quarter with a 15.7% share of the market, down from 19.7% in the same period last year and barely ahead of Huawei's 15.5%, per the research outfit.

In stark contrast with Apple's slide, Huawei sales soared by almost 70% compared with the first three months of 2023.

Counterpoint research analyst Ivan Lam said in a note that Huawei's surge had directly affected iPhone sales in China. Apple had also been hit by fewer consumers replacing their smartphones, he added.

Huawei's rise has given Apple CEO Tim Cook a new headache, given he's already dealing with disappointing iPhone 15 sales and government bans in China. Cook went to China in March to visit Apple's newest store in Shanghai and attend the high-profile China Development Forum in Beijing.

Huawei recently released a new series of smartphones called the Pura 70 that has an advanced camera system similar to the trio of lenses on the iPhone Pro range .

The new phones, which start at $760, provide Huawei with a new opportunity to win over Chinese customers from Apple. Last year the company launched the Mate 60 Pro series that was aimed at iPhone 15 buyers.

Despite the stiff competition, Lam said iPhone sales could still reverse their downward slide.

""We are seeing slow but steady improvement from week to week, so momentum could be shifting,"" he said. ""For the second quarter, the possibility of new color options combined with aggressive sales initiatives could bring the brand back into positive territory.""

The 19% decline is slightly better than the 24% slide that Counterpoint had estimated for the first six weeks of the year.

Huawei is not only making a roaring comeback in China, it is also on the verge of overtaking Apple in the world’s largest smartphone market.

The Shenzhen-based conglomerate, which has been a flashpoint in the escalating rivalry between Washington and Beijing, saw 70% year-on-year growth in its smartphone sales in China in the first quarter, while Apple’s sales declined by more than 19%, according to Counterpoint Research.

“Apple’s sales were subdued during the quarter as Huawei’s comeback has directly impacted Apple in the premium segment,” said Ivan Lam, senior research analyst at Counterpoint.

The iPhone maker, which led China’s smartphone market with a share of nearly 20% in the first quarter of 2023, has fallen to the third spot in the first three months of this year, according to Counterpoint. Its market share now stands at 15.7%, while Huawei’s has jumped to 15.5%, from 9.3% last year.

Huawei’s popular Mate 60 Pro smartphone made headlines last year when the US government sought more information about the model, which included a sophisticated processor. Its debut shocked industry experts who questioned how the company could acquire such a chip following sweeping efforts by the United States to restrict China’s access to foreign chip technology because of national security concerns.

Counterpoint’s data comes just days after another market research firm IDC said Apple’s global smartphone sales had tumbled 10% in the first quarter, mainly because of loss of momentum in China.

China is the largest market behind the United States for Apple, but the company is facing a challenging time in the world’s second-largest economy. Chinese consumers, who once would have considered Apple, are now turning to Chinese brands.

Overall smartphone sales in China grew 1.5% in the first quarter, according to Counterpoint. Local smartphone makers Vivo and Honor were the top two brands by market share."

Must have an Apple Card to have an Apple savings account

No joint Apple savings account options Who is Apple savings account good for? To have an Apple savings account, you must be an Apple Card user.

It’s also good for those who want a high-yield savings account and cash back on daily purchases. It’s managed right from your Wallet app and has no foreign transaction fees, late fees, or annual fees. Who shouldn’t use an Apple savings account? To use an Apple savings account, you need to have an Apple Card. While you can technically access your Apple Card details via browser on an Android device, you must add your Apple Card to an iPhone or iPad to use it. This means you’ll need an Apple device if you want the Apple Card or an Apple savings account. Additionally, Apple doesn’t offer full-featured banking accounts with loans, certificates of deposit (CDs), and other extras you might expect with a standard banking institution. If you prefer to keep everything under one roof, consider an alternative bank.

Apple rates and products

Right now, your banking options with Apple are limited. However, its high-yield savings account offers an attractive rate of 4.5% APY.

Apple’s new Savings account is gaining a lot of buzz—and for good reason. As a high-yield savings account, it offers an impressive APY of 4.50%, a rate that is significantly higher than that of standard savings accounts.

While 4.5% is a great rate, it isn’t the highest offered. Additionally, these rates aren’t available to Android users as you must have an Apple Card to have a Savings account. Check out our list of current high-yield savings accounts for alternative options.

How does Apple Card work?

To use an Apple Card, you must have an iPhone or iPad where the card can be added to your Apple Wallet. You also won’t get a physical card in the mail unless you specifically request a titanium one; otherwise, it lives in your digital wallet.

You'll earn cash back, called Daily Cash back, on every purchase you make; 3% with select retailers, such as Apple and T-Mobile, and 2% cash back when using the Apple Card with Apple Pay. If a merchant doesn’t accept Apple Pay, you’ll earn 1% cash back instead.

You can then deposit your Daily Cash into a Savings account or an Apple Cash card. If you have neither, you can also receive a statement credit instead.

Other services Apple offers

Apple Pay: Using your Wallet, pay using any stored card at retailers in person, in an app, or online, provided they accept Apple Pay. It’s a contactless payment method that takes a few taps.

Online banking: Apple is a bit different than your standard online bank or credit union. All your Apple Card and Apple Savings transactions are handled via the Wallet app on your iPhone or iPad. Additionally, you can access your account details via a web browser.

The Apple platform and customer support

Apple’s platform is easy to use and understand thanks to its simple user interface (UI). To access support for Apple's financial services, contact them by phone or through Messages in your Wallet. Depending on your inquiry, you may be referred to Goldman Sachs, which is the issuing bank for Apple Card and Apple Savings accounts.

Is Apple secure?

Apple responds to any vulnerabilities relatively quickly, such as the patch updates released in August 2022 that addressed issues with its Apple smart watches which were making them vulnerable to hackers. While it doesn't have any security issues specific to its banking products in particular, its issuing bank, Goldman Sachs, has had some issues in the past. For example, in September 2023, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) fined it $6 million for a breach of its communications policy that took place over a 10-year period.

Apple user reviews

Customers appreciate the ability to finance their Apple purchases over time without interest and enjoy earning up to 3% cash back on their purchases. However, users caution that it might not be as useful to someone who isn't enmeshed in everything Apple, and suggest there are better alternatives for those with different spending needs.

Is Apple right for you?

If you’re an Apple enthusiast, an Apple Savings account and Apple Card might be right for simple, everyday spending.

The board asked chief financial officer Michael Dastoor to step in as interim CEO on April 19 after putting Wilson on leave April 15, according to the filing. Jabil didn’t provide information about the concern or incident that launched the probe, only saying that the behavior that prompted it is unrelated to the company’s financial statements or financial reporting. Wilson is two weeks away from completing his first year in the CEO seat after taking it May 1, 2023. Jabil, with more than 140,000 employees globally, maintains a hotline through third-party platform Resolver to anonymously report code of ethics violations or other complaints. The company is based in Tampa Bay, Fla., and manufactures electronic parts for tech companies. Its largest customers include Apple, Cisco Systems, Dell Technologies, HP, and General Electric.

It is unclear who is leading the Jabil investigation. Typically, if an investigation into a CEO’s conduct originates with financial concerns, the audit committee would initiate and lead it, said Matteo Tonello, a corporate governance expert and managing director at the Conference Board. In cases outside of financials, there are multiple approaches the board can take, he told Fortune. For instance, the board could form an internal committee to oversee the investigation while an outside law firm or consultant conducts it. Typically, when an investigation involves the CEO, it’s led by the board to avoid executives undertaking a review of their boss.

Investigations can involve data obtained from text-based searches of company servers; mirroring a CEO’s cell phone or other devices; conducting interviews with employees, contractors, or customers; and reviewing documents. Law firms are often tapped because they have expertise in avoiding infringing on the rights of those being investigated, said Tonello. Companies could subject themselves to liability after an investigation because of the way the probe was conducted; sometimes CEOs hire their own counsel to represent them while an investigation is underway. “That doesn’t mean if you hire a law firm, the company wouldn’t be involved,” he noted, adding that legal and compliance staff are generally looped in along with the general counsel.

The length of probes varies, Tonello said; sometimes it concludes in a few days or weeks while others take months. “It depends on the nature of the allegations and what they entail,” he said.

A spokesman for Jabil would not comment beyond what the company said in the filing, only noting that Dastoor has the support of the senior leadership team while he steps in for Wilson. “Trust, accountability, and integrity are core to our company culture, and we are committed to upholding these principles,” Timur Aydin, director of enterprise content and media, said in a statement to Fortune.

Wilson, 58, first joined the company in 2000 in Livingston, Scotland, as a business unit coordinator, and served successful stints leading Jabil’s businesses in Europe, Asia, and the U.S. His last role before taking the corner office in Florida was as CEO of Jabil’s Green Point organization in Asia. The company announced in November 2022 that Wilson would take the reins from former CEO Mark Mondello the following May, which culminated in an orderly transition at the manufacturer, with hardly a ripple. Mondello, who has more than three decades of tenure at the company, still serves as its chairman.

In connection with Wilson’s promotion last year, the board bumped up his pay about 43% to a base salary of about $1 million, which he’ll continue to collect while the investigation pans out. His total compensation last year was valued at $10.2 million, largely driven by a stock award valued at $6.2 million. His sons, Jordan Wilson and Adam Wilson, both hold the title of business unit coordinator, the same one their father held.

Jabil, which had net revenues of $34.7 billion in fiscal 2023, disclosed that 17% of its net revenue comes from sales to Apple. A key tenet of its strategy is to build and maintain long-term relationships with leading companies in expanding industries that need highly automated, continuous flow manufacturing operations around the globe."

The TV deal could be announced as soon as this month, with the tournament set to be held in the U.S. next summer, reported the New York Times, citing three people familiar with the matter.

The agreement with Apple would be unique for FIFA, which usually strikes deals with several TV providers in different countries for global tournaments such as the World Cup.

By contrast, the Apple deal may reportedly omit free-to-air-rights, which could make the tournament available to Apple TV+ subscribers only—a point that has raised concern among some FIFA senior executives, according to the Times.

“As a general practice, FIFA does not confirm or deny commercial discussions,” a FIFA spokesperson told Fortune.

Apple struck a similarly exclusive 10-year deal to secure the streaming rights for Major League Soccer at a $2.5 billion price tag last year. The agreement, which Apple dubbed MLS Season Pass, was prescient for the tech company. Subscriptions to Apple TV+ jumped by more than 100,000 in one day, compared to around 6,000 the day before, after World Cup winner Lionel Messi played his first game with MLS Club Inter Miami CF in June, the Wall Street Journal reported.

Although Apple does not break out revenue for Apple TV+, the services business segment it belongs to netted the company $85.2 billion in net sales in 2023, up 9% from $78.1 billion the prior year, according to the company’s most recent 10K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The competition for live sports has heated up recently as streaming companies look to live sports to grow. Peacock streamed its third exclusive National Football League game in March and Amazon Prime just completed its second year of a $1 billion-per-season deal to stream the NFL’s Thursday Night Football programming. Apple has recently increased its interest in live sports deals as well.

The tech company is competing with other streamers such as Amazon Prime Video, Google’s YouTube, and Netflix to secure the rights to some NBA games, the Athletic reported Monday. Apple also struck a streaming rights deal with Major League baseball in 2022.

The new World Cup-style tournament, which FIFA previously said would be called the Mundial de Clubes FIFA (although that name is reportedly under review), will include 32 teams. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has long pushed for the competition that would pit some of the world’s best soccer clubs against each other every four years. Powerhouse clubs such as FC Bayern Munich, Paris Saint-Germain FC, and Serie A champions Inter Milan are already qualified to participate, according to FIFA."

The quiet launch of Huawei’s Mate 60 Pro is transforming China’s phone market as consumers shift to local brands. Apple’s shipments tumbled 19% year on year in the first quarter of 2024, the company’s worst performance since 2020, according to data from Counterpoint Research.

The U.S. company now has market share of around 15.7%, down from 19.7% a year ago. The drop puts Apple in third place in China’s smartphone market, behind Vivo and Honor.

Apple’s decline contrasts with Huawei’s rise. The Chinese smartphone-maker’s sales in the first quarter of 2024 jumped by almost 70%. It now has 15.5% of China’s phone market, putting it just behind Apple. Counterpoint partly attributed Huawei’s growth to the company’s 5G smartphone, giving the tech giant “a massive share in the $600-plus premium segment.”

Honor, a former Huawei subsidiary spun off in 2020, is in second place after its sales grew 11.5% year on year.

Apple led the Chinese smartphone market for 2023 as a whole, ahead of Vivo, Oppo, and Xiaomi, according to Counterpoint data.

Fierce competition in China helped to knock Apple from its perch as the top global seller of smartphones last quarter, according to an IDC report released last week. South Korea’s Samsung is now in first place.

Huawei’s rise

Chinese consumers could be attracted by the price of Huawei’s 5G phone, which is cheaper than Apple’s iPhone. But Chinese media also promoted the Mate 60 Pro, which features a domestically produced advanced chip, as a source of national pride upon its launch last year.

Huawei sold 1.6 million Mate 60 Pro handsets in the six weeks following its launch, and sales have remained strong since.

A resurgent Huawei is just one of many challenges to Apple’s business in China. The iPhone maker is dealing with greater regulatory scrutiny: Beijing reportedly told government officials and employees at state-owned enterprises to stop using iPhones, and regulators ordered Apple to remove several foreign programs, like WhatsApp, Threads, and Signal, from its China app store last week because of “national security concerns.”

Apple is also trying to diversify its supply chain to rely less on Chinese suppliers. CEO Tim Cook made a whirlwind visit to Southeast Asia last week which may have been an effort to “hedge [Apple’s] supply-chain bets,” analysts previously told Fortune."

Apple announced this week that it will host a video-streamed online event on May 7, where the company is expected to reveal new iPads and iPad accessories. The big giveaway is the animation included in the event announcement on Apple's website, which shows a hand flicking around an Apple Pencil.

There are no official details on what Apple will announce or release on May 7. However, a significant update to the iPad Pro and iPad Air series, an upgraded Apple Pencil, and an updated Magic Keyboard are expected, according to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, one of the most reliable sources when it comes to unreleased Apple products.

The last time new iPads were released was in 2022, when some models got a refresh, including a standard 10th-generation iPad and iPad Air and Pro models. The iPad Mini hasn't been updated since 2021. In 2023, the only iPad-related devices Apple released included a USB-C Apple Pencil.

New iPad Pros with OLED displays

The expected upcoming iPad Pros could be quite a significant update. The most exciting and plausible update coming to the new iPads is sharper OLED displays for the Pro models, according to Gurman — the same kind of displays found on iPhones since 2017.

If accurate, OLED displays have the potential to bring dramatic improvements to viewing videos and whatever you do on an iPad that uses the display. At the same time, OLED displays could hike the minimum price even further for the iPad Pro models, which are already the most expensive devices among the best iPads, starting at $799.

Beyond a totally new display, the new iPad Pros are said to have noticeably thinner designs, according to 9to5Mac.

The iPad Pros are widely expected to run on Apple's M3 processor, which was introduced with the latest MacBook Air and base MacBook Pro models.

A new, larger iPad Air

Alongside a refreshed iPad Air with a typical display size of around 11 inches, Apple is expected to release a new iPad Air model with a 12.9-inch display for the first time, according to Gurman, matching the display size of the larger iPad Pro model.

The iPad Air has only been available in a 10.9-inch model to this point. Antonio Villas-Boas/Business Insider

It's widely expected that the upcoming iPad Air models will be upgraded from Apple's M1 processor to Apple's M2 processor, which was introduced in 2022 for various Mac laptops, like the 2022 MacBook Air and 2022 13-inch MacBook Pro. It would be a welcome upgrade for professionals using the iPad Air for creative visual work, but it's unlikely to make much of a difference for basic iPad use, like video streaming, social media scrolling, web browsing, emailing, or even playing games.

An Apple Pencil you can squeeze

An expected new Apple Pencil could register squeezes from your fingers to do different things, according to 9to5Mac, which referenced evidence of a new squeeze gesture in the iPadOS 17.5 beta version. The new squeeze gesture would likely activate customizable functions.

An upgraded Magic Keyboard

A new Magic Keyboard that's supposedly designed for the new iPad Pros will reportedly have an aluminum top to address the poor durability of the current Magic Keyboard, according to Gurman. A larger trackpad is also said to be expected. The whole package could make the iPad Pro and Magic Keyboard combination look similar to a Mac laptop."
