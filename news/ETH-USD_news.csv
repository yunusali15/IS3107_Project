Coinbase is the largest centralized crypto exchange in the U.S., posting $273 million in net income for the fourth quarter of 2023, putting the firm’s net profitability for all of 2023 at $95 million.

“Coinbase has always taken a long-term approach focusing on building in a compliant manner, even when it wasn’t the popular choice,” CEO Brian Armstrong said on a February earnings call. “Many of our competitors cut corners and broke laws to get big fast, and we’ve seen how that strategy played out.”

Alesia Haas joined the company in April 2018. She previously was CFO for Sculptor Capital Management (formerly Och-Ziff Capital Management Group), a global institutional alternative asset manager. She also served as CFO and head of strategy for OneWest Bank.

In a conversation with Fortune, Haas shared insights on Bitcoin’s record high, the latest crypto bull market, the SEC’s take on Ethereum, Sam Bankman-Fried’s sentencing, and what drew her to the world of crypto from traditional finance.

(This interview has been edited for length and clarity.)

Earlier this month, Bitcoin reached a record high above $72,000. Can you share some insight on what this means in a larger sense?

I think it’s important with crypto to zoom out and look at what has happened since the Bitcoin white paper and crypto first came on the scene. You’ve seen four price cycles. What I love about looking at these price cycles is that every peak is higher than its last peak. And every trough is higher than the last trough.

If you look at this, you have a lot of volatility, but there is this steady up and into-the-right curve. When you look at the one-, three-, five-, and 10-year return of Bitcoin against every other asset, it has been one of the top performing assets over any other comparable.

A lot of this was driven by the Bitcoin ETFs. What I think is important to note is that ETFs unlock new demand for this asset class. Previously, a lot of investment advisors couldn’t access Bitcoin because of their investment mandates. Now they can buy Bitcoin in an ETF wrapper, and so it opens up new available capital.

What does Bitcoin’s rise mean for other cryptocurrencies, particularly Ethereum?

I think that we’re starting to see differentiation between different cryptocurrencies and Bitcoin, where Bitcoin is a store-of-value asset, and people are putting it in their portfolio as an important store-of-value in wealth creation.

Ethereum has become the protocol that developers are increasingly choosing to build decentralized applications on top of. While Bitcoin is the largest asset, we generally see “a rising tide lifts all ships” effect where crypto then comes up. But you’re starting to see differentiation because people are choosing Ethereum, and it is increasingly going to change depending on developer activity and user activity of that platform. Stablecoins and NFTs are built on Ethereum. There are just a lot of new use cases built on top of that protocol.

Speaking of Ethereum, what’s the latest with this SEC now attempting to define it as a security?

Ethereum is not a security. Historically, the SEC has repeatedly said that Ether isn’t a security. The CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] has said that Ether isn’t a security. The core problem here is that we still do not have comprehensive crypto regulation at the federal level in the United States. And this is something that we feel passionately about. It’s so critical to get regulatory clarity so we can have a clear, equitable, applied regulatory framework that will protect consumers and ensure responsible markets—and also protect businesses like Coinbase, so we know how we can bring compliant products to the market and continue innovation here in America.

What can we learn from the latest crypto bull market?

In general, what we’re seeing is similar to past bull markets, whereas crypto prices rise, you see an increase in volatility, then you see an increase in engagement. As we shared on our Q4 earnings call in February, we saw elevated engagement, net inflows across the board in retail institutional, and we saw higher trading volumes.

With almost $12 billion of net inflows into ETFs, we’ve seen a market cap of over $2.5 trillion. What this does is it puts crypto back in the headlines. It has become a topic of conversation in households. And we’re seeing really great engagement from customers who sort of went dormant a little bit in 2021, and they’re saying, “Oh, this asset class is back.”

The crypto sector nosedived after FTX imploded and cofounder Sam Bankman-Fried was arrested. He was just sentenced to 25 years in prison. Has the industry finally turned a page?

Well, fraud is fraud. And I’m pleased to see the process being followed when you have fraud in the markets. It’s a travesty that occurred. But I think we’ve moved on, and I think the market has largely moved on. Coinbase was always focused on compliance. We are excited to build and regain the trust of our customers. But there has been a flight to quality. We’ve seen that flight to quality now over the past year. And we’re pleased to continue to see people’s focus and growth on good companies here.

Before joining Coinbase, you worked in asset management, as a CFO, and held senior roles at Merrill Lynch and General Electric. What most attracted you to your current company?

I’m old enough that I grew up in the early internet era and have just watched the transformation of how technology creates new use cases. When I learned about blockchain, I could see that if you tokenize real-world assets—and send value peer to peer—that was going to create a more inclusive, faster, and cheaper financial system. And that was such an exciting thing to be a part of.

I have worked for banks and asset managers, and I saw how many people touch the transaction just to move money from me to you, and how many different steps and different market participants it takes. I saw the cost. I saw the friction. And I said, “If technology solves this, it will be adopted. It’s a matter of when, not if.” I wanted to be part of that excitement in the journey to build trusted products in this ecosystem.

Coming from traditional finance, I knew that if you’re holding customers’ assets, their wealth, their investments, you need to become a trusted brand. I thought I could really contribute value to Coinbase.

How would you describe the role of digital assets in the future of finance?

Well, first of all, it’s already here: 52 million Americans own crypto. We now have ETFs for anybody with a retirement account to own crypto. You can now send a U.S. dollar in the form of a stablecoin to anyone in the world, anywhere, anytime, cheaply and instantly. It’s amazing that we’re already here.

I think what we’ll see is an increasing number of transactions happening on the blockchain. We’ll tokenize more real-world assets. Just last week, BlackRock announced they’re tokenizing a money-market fund. Now we have money-market funds where you can earn high yields but in tokenized form.

These are new ways that we can bring the global world together in a peer-to-peer way—fewer intermediaries, lower costs—and tokenize real-world assets, which makes those assets more available to more people in more markets. I think that’s really exciting."
"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",Leo Schwartz,"Paradigm leads $225 million round for Monad Labs, which is building a layer-1 blockchain to take on Ethereum and Solana",The crypto firm founded by ex-Jump Crypto traders also received investment from Electric Capital and Neil Mehta's Greenoaks Capital.,https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/04/09/monad-paradigm-greenoaks-jump-crypto-funding-225-million/,"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/crypto-coins-4.jpeg?resize=1200,600",2024-04-09 12:00:00+00:00,"With crypto markets roaring back, different blockchains are jockeying to become the solution that hoovers up demand in the next wave, just as Bitcoin and Ethereum did in past cycles.

A new player on the scene, Monad Labs, finalized a $225 million round led by Paradigm with additional funding by investors including Electric Capital and Greenoaks to build a layer 1 blockchain to challenge competitors such as Solana and Sui. (Fortune previously reported that Monad was in talks with Paradigm to raise money at a $3 billion valuation in March.)

In an exclusive interview, Monad founder Keone Hon said Monad’s innovation comes from rebuilding Ethereum’s blockchain from the ground up—maintaining the ability to execute smart contracts while completing transactions at faster speeds, higher volumes, and lower costs. While other new blockchains have a similar value proposition, Monad is compatible with the program powering Ethereum, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), meaning developers can port over applications built for Ethereum.

“We’re emerging from roughly two years of development,” Hon said. “At a time when a lot of the research community was focused on roll-up, data availability, and other directions of scaling, Monad basically went really deep on the pure execution side.”

The crowded layer 1 landscape

Since the launch of Bitcoin in 2009, developers have introduced new blockchains that promise an array of new capabilities, from cheaper and faster transactions to applications like decentralized exchanges or lending protocols that can operate on top of a blockchain.

Although Ethereum launched in 2015 with the innovation of smart contracts, it has struggled to scale with increased demand, meaning transactions often come with high execution fees, known as “gas,” or are slow to be processed. More recent competitors—including Solana, which launched in 2020—promised faster speeds at lower costs but still suffer from congestion issues.

Hon worked for eight years at Jump Trading, the secretive Chicago-based high-frequency trading firm, building systems that could process large numbers of transactions quickly. He soon branched out into Jump’s crypto arm, working alongside Monad cofounder James Hunsaker.

“We realized there was a huge need for a more performant EVM, and that in spite of this need, no one was really working on this problem,” Hon told Fortune.

Unlike many new blockchains, Monad will have full support for the EVM bytecode, the standard that many developers build on when coding decentralized applications. Hon described EVM as the Web3 equivalent of JavaScript in the early 2000s. It’s used by blockchains including Ethereum, Polygon, Avalanche, Binance Smart Chain, and Optimism. “Anyone who’s built an app for any of those blockchains can port it into Monad without any changes.”

Avichal Garg, managing partner of Electric Capital, said 90% of developers working on multiple crypto ecosystems are working only in EVM chains, pointing to a recent report from his firm. While that means that Monad doesn’t get the same benefits of redesigning its entire programming language like other new blockchains such as Aptos and Sui, Garg said it still gets most of the benefits.

“The way you go to market is you hit the EVM compatibility and suck over a bunch of devs,” he told Fortune. “To us, it felt like this is the playbook.”

‘A much more performant blockchain’

After raising a $19 million seed round announced in 2023, Monad’s $225 million funding round represents the largest crypto fundraise of 2024 so far, according to Crunchbase’s Web3 Tracker, signaling that the sector’s bear market is beginning to thaw. Paradigm, the crypto VC firm leading the round, is reportedly raising a new fund over $750 million. The round also represents one of the first crypto deals for Greenoaks Capital, the VC firm led by veteran investor Neil Mehta, after a small bet on FTX.

While Jump incubated a number of crypto projects, including Wormhole and Pyth Network, Hon said Monad is completely separate from the trading firm. Jump has been embroiled in scandal due to its role in the collapse of the so-called stablecoin project Terraform Labs led by Do Kwon, whose civil trial resulted in a guilty verdict in federal court last week. Hunsaker testified at the proceedings, where it was revealed that he filed a whistleblower complaint with the Securities and Exchange Commission against his former employer.

Armed with its new round of funding, Hon said that Monad aims to deploy its mainnet by the end of the year, as well as a testnet in the next couple of months. Monad Labs currently has around 30 employees and plans for a native token, although Hon declined to comment on whether it would launch with the mainnet.

While crypto companies continue to chase mainstream adoption, Hon said Monad’s first use case will likely be for the type of high-frequency trading he performed at Jump, citing that the biggest stock and futures exchanges in the world process between 500 million and 1 billion transactions per day.

“If we want the scale of an exchange, like Nasdaq or a CME, to be possible on the blockchain, we need a much more performant blockchain than what exists right now,” he told Fortune.

Hon also pointed to other applications that could be enabled by a blockchain with high transaction capacity and low fees, such as games. A program like RuneScape might have a player picking up 50 items in an hour, meaning that a blockchain-based game would need to update their stats each time, with each update representing a new transaction that needs to be cheap and fast enough to make economic sense on a blockchain.

While VCs are betting big on Monad, Garg said his investment doesn’t preclude other blockchains from succeeding—just in different capacities. “We think of these ecosystems in a non-zero-sum way,” Garg told Fortune. “Just because Facebook exists doesn’t mean that Twitter and LinkedIn and TikTok and Instagram and WhatsApp can’t exist.”"
"{'id': 'fortune', 'name': 'Fortune'}",Leo Schwartz,VanEck CEO says brokerage platforms aren’t yet recommending Bitcoin ETFs: ‘There’s a long ways to go’,Jan van Eck told Fortune that he doesn't expect the SEC to approve an Ethereum ETF.,https://fortune.com/crypto/2024/04/11/vaneck-jan-ceo-bitcoin-etf-ethereum-sec-brokerage/,"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1255803463-e1712837964842.jpg?resize=1200,600",2024-04-11 17:41:11+00:00,"The approval of spot Bitcoin ETFs in January kicked off a frenzy as investors poured billions of dollars into the brand-new investment vehicles launched by financial mainstays like BlackRock and Fidelity. But even as the total trading volume of the asset class passed $200 billion, Jan van Eck, CEO of asset manager VanEck, one of the major issuers, said that Bitcoin ETFs are still in their infancy.

Speaking to Fortune on the sidelines of Paris Blockchain Week, van Eck said brokerage platforms aren’t yet allowing advisors to recommend Bitcoin ETFs, though there have been reports that firms such as Morgan Stanley are evaluating them. “Those are our biggest customer bases,” van Eck told Fortune. “So there’s a long ways to go.”

For now, the demand has mainly come from retail customers, although he expects that to change as platforms gain approval to start pushing Bitcoin ETFs. “Paper moves first in this world, and then decisions get made,” van Eck said, predicting that the shift could come this quarter.

‘Don’t get disrupted’

Founded by van Eck’s father in 1955, VanEck has long been at the forefront of alternative assets. John van Eck pivoted to gold investing as he worried about inflation, launching the first U.S. gold stock fund in 1968. “If you’re running a business, you’ve got to make sure that you don’t get disrupted,” his son told Fortune.

In 2017, VanEck became the first ETF issuer to file for a spot Bitcoin ETF, a few years after the Winklevoss-led Gemini applied for one in 2013. The Securities and Exchange Commission rejected potential issuers, with the approval process eventually moving forward after crypto firm Grayscale sued the agency to convert its Bitcoin trust into an ETF.

Now, with seven companies, including VanEck, applying for a spot Ethereum ETF, van Eck expressed skepticism that the agency would move forward with an approval. “Paperwork usually precedes action from a regulator,” he said. “And there’s no paperwork movements.”

He added that another lawsuit likely would be necessary to push the agency for approval, but there may be less appetite among stakeholders for another lengthy court battle.

‘People thought they were totally crazy’

With a crowded field of 12 Bitcoin ETFs, the question is whether the field will consolidate, with some issuers pulling out or acquiring competitors. VanEck is currently middle of the pack with around $600 million in assets under management, and BlackRock and Fidelity running away with the field.

Despite his firm’s slower start, van Eck said he’s been pleased with the progress. “We’d love to have $600 million in an ETF in its first three months,” he told Fortune. “The chances of that happening statistically in the ETF industry is probably 1%.” Still, he cautioned that because of the low management fees many of the issuers are charging, the vehicles won’t be profit drivers.

Another question is whether issuers will branch out to other custodians, after every firm, with the exception of VanEck, initially chose Coinbase. VanEck instead went with Gemini, which van Eck said was a “tip of the hat” to the firm being the first to apply for a Bitcoin ETF. “People thought they were totally crazy when they filed,” he told Fortune. He added that the firm would soon add a backup custodian.

VanEck is also expanding into other areas of crypto. In early April, van Eck’s son, Nick, announced the launch of his own digital asset firm, a stablecoin company called Agora. His father’s company would serve as the manager of its reserves, similar to how Cantor Fitzgerald holds U.S. Treasuries for Tether.

Despite Tether’s dominance in the stablecoin landscape, van Eck said there’s room for competition, especially with Tether’s wildcat status in the U.S. “A lot of firms are going through regulatory approval,” he told Fortune. “There’s plenty of room for exchanges to use other stables.”"
